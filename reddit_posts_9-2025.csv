I traveled to Boston two weeks ago for my first open mic night, and while the open mic night was exhilarating, I struggled with the before and after. 

Keeping it real, I have a van I have basically converted into a sensory safe place for me. I do not normally announce this. I can usually quietly retreat for a moment and no one notices. However, it is too big for parking garages, and I’m an idiot for finding this out the hard way. 

While I did finally find parking, I was definitely having to pay stupid tax for not realizing my van is not city friendly. 

I did look on some apps to see if spots available in personal parking, but Vanly isn’t a thing in Boston I guess. 

I’m trying to figure out how to adapt. I want to do more open mic nights. 

The first open mic I would do is around broadway and Arlington? I’m not mentioning exact place because of the other comics saw this… it’s gonna be open season joking on my ass. 😆 

I can use public transportation but also I am not used to it. 

It’s hard to be this vulnerable out in the open, but if there are any suggestions for ways that may help me adapt and succeed in my dream, I would be forever grateful.

The short story is that I work almost exclusively with clients transferring to the Boston area, and now that it's optional for renters to pay a broker fee, most clients aren't interested in doing so. (Shocker, I know.)

Initially, I thought I'd be out of the business entirely by now, but I've had a couple of new clients unexpectedly pop up. (For the time being, some employers are still covering the broker fee for relocations.)  So twice now I've had that moment of: ""wow, I've just toured my last property"" only to later find out later I wasn't quite finished. Potentially, I showed my last property on Tuesday. We shall see.

In the meantime, it would be a shame not to share a few stories before I go. Because…the public has a right know.

**SELECT STORIES**

 **Free food**

 A couple years ago, my clients and I are waiting in the lobby at an apartment building in Quincy for a listing agent who is running 30 minutes late. As I'm having a conversation with my clients, a middle-aged man comes into the building, sees a free box of dog treats and says ""hey look, free food"" as he grabs the box and takes it away. Several minutes later, he comes back downstairs and puts the box back on the table, complaining that the cookies were too hard to chew. The look on my clients' faces suggested that they were probably not going to rent in this buildling.

 **Unwanted Visitor**

I've found out the hard way that even if a unit is supposed to be empty, it's safer to knock first. On multiple occasions, I've entered units that were supposedly empty only to find people inside. Once, my clients and I ended up entering the wrong unit by mistake because the property manager listed a unit on the tour sheet that we were NOT supposed to visit. Since we were given a master key, the door unlocked anyway and we came face to face with some very surprised tenants.

 One of the more bizarre encounters of walking in on clients was when I went to show a 4 bed - 2 bath unit in Brookline. I knew the unit was still tenanted, but I didn't know if anybody would be home. The listing agent didn't show up; it was just me with my clients joining virtually via a video call.

 As soon as I entered, I was met by a college-aged male who complained to me that the agent never notified him about the tour (I had given the listing agent 48 hours to notify the tenants) and it was too early on a Sunday morning to be touring the unit (it was 11am on a Monday morning). He then demanded that I take my shoes off, told me I could not make any noise, and that I couldn't tour the living room because he and a ""guest"" were sleeping in there. (The living room had been converted into a makeshift bedroom which was closed off by a curtain over the doorway.)

 While this young man was giving me instructions, a 3rd occupant comes downstairs and leaves. Now I'm starting to wonder just how many more people I am going to encounter.

 I begin the tour starting with the kitchen, at which time a college-aged female comes down from the upstairs bathroom - wearing pajamas - and enters a bedroom where she and her boyfriend were apparently still sleeping. In an upstairs bedroom, I find another occupant in her pajamas. All told, I found evidence of at least 7 people living in that small unit, although there could have been one or two more. (I'll never no for sure.)

**Justice is Served**

 One of the biggest headaches that renters face is landlords who try to unfairly deduct money from the security deposit. In one particular case, my clients had caused minor damage upon moveout (which the clients were willing to pay for) but the property manager wanted to take out extra money for issues that the clients were clearly not responsible for. Since my clients had already moved back to Europe, taking the landlord to small claims court to fight these charges was not an option. And as long as I didn't agree for the extra charges to be taken out of the deposit, the property manager refused to hand over any amount (which was around $5000-60000).

 Most renters - and many landlords - are not aware that MA has very strict requirements regarding the security deposit and how it is handled. Using this to my advantage, I emailed the property manager on day 29 after move-out, explaining that he had 1 day to return the security deposit before the landlord would be hit with a penalty worth three times the security deposit amount. The entire security deposit was returned the next day.

 **The Time Waster**

 Many of my clients were a pleasure to work with, but of course there were some exceptions. One of those clients was a lady whose search criteria changed drastically from day to day. Initially we were looking mainly at apartment complexes. Then the budget was cut and we were looking exclusively at private options in an entirely different area. Then the budget changed again and we started looking everywhere. This went on for about 3 weeks.

 In the meantime, I started becoming curious about what my client did for a living. At some point, she remarked that her job was related to death (in an obvious effort to gain some ""sympathy points."") It later turns out that she worked in the legal department of a pharmaceutical company, and her job was to clear her company of wrongdoing each time a patient died during experimental treatments. (Poor lady.)

 I don't know if it was a coincidence, but I spent more time with this client than almost any other individual I had ever worked with. And instead of renting a place, she ended up not transferring to Boston all (which means I made exactly $0 from this client).

 **Listing Agent with Attitude**

 Once I was touring units with a couple who had a budget of around $7000-8000, so we were looking for something nice and modern. One of the places we visited was a large two family (located around the Watertown/Newton area). The listing agent was with us this time, but we probably would have been better off without him.

Upon entering the unit, a middle-aged woman came running down the stairs believing that we were intruders. The listing agent very rudely explained that we were here to tour the unit, and then proceeded to ignore the lady for the rest of the tour.

Pro tip for listing agents: don't piss off the tenants. The house was a disaster, and I'm not sure if it wasn't on purpose. On the second floor banister, women's panties and bras were hanging to dry, and there also clothes that looked like they had been randomly thrown everywhere. When we tried to tour one of the bedrooms, a 20-something male opened the door and refused to let us in. I got the impression that there was something in that room that the young man did not want us to see.

 Once we were outside (and feeling a little safer), the listing agent explained that these tenants never responded to messages and he was tired of dealing with them. Which is fair I guess. But yeah, that was awkward.

**CONFESSIONS**

 OK, I get it: you didn't click on the title of this post for some cheesy stories; you came here for the good stuff. So, let's talk about the ""dark side"" of the real estate business.

 Obviously, not all real estate agents are ""scum"" (depending on who you talk to) but from my personal experiences I cannot claim in good faith that unethical behavior among agents is the exception (as opposed to the rule). Let's start with an easy example.

 **Phishing for Clients**

 There are two main variants of this scheme, and both are very common. The first is to post ""too-good-to-be-true"" fake listings on websites in order to pick up clients. One of the most annoying aspects of my job was getting sent a bunch of listings from apartments.coms and having to sort through which are real vs. fake in order to schedule tours for units that actually existed. (**edit:** typically over half of the requested listings were fake.)

A second way agents phish for clients is to copy a real listing and repost it with their own contact information. Using this method, an unscrupulous agent attempts to steal potential clients away from the listing agent. With the current broker fee rules, this would potentially make a tenant believe they are working with the listing agent (which would incur no broker fee) when in fact they are working with an agent who will try to squeeze a broker fee out of the tenants.

**Artificial Intelligence photos**

The use of AI to enhance real estate photos has gotten out of hand. To be clear, I have no issue with using AI technology for marketing purposes in order to make photos look better. But when a client cannot recognize an apartment from the photos in the listing, there is a problem. I recently saw a listing which had two AI generated photos of the same room, with one version of the room having 3 windows while the other version of the room had only 2.

**Forcing the Tenant to Pay both Agents**

Although a tenant no longer pays the listing agent - thanks to a new law that took effect in August - this practice went on for decades and many people don't realize had unethical it actually was. To explain the scheme, it's important to understand the background. First of all, once generic real estate sites (such as Zillow) started popping up, tenants no longer needed agents to find properties, which meant landlords no longer needed agents to find tenants. But rather than accept this new reality, agents in certain locations such as Boston devised a scheme that would force tenants to pay broker fees whether they wanted to or not.

 In short, the listing agent charged the tenant a 1-month broker fee which had to be paid before the fully-executed lease would be handed over to the tenant. If the tenant had an agent, the listing agent would then split this fee with that agent. And if the tenant did not have an agent, the listing agent would keep the entire 1-month broker fee. As a result of this scheme, both the listing agent and tenant's agent were guaranteed to get paid. The two biggest issues with this scheme were that (1) the tenant was forced to pay for a service whether they wanted to or not and (2) the tenant was forced to pay for an agent who represented the interests of the landlord (which were in opposition to the interests of the tenant).

 **No Co-Broke Listings**

Thankfully, no-co-broke listings are also mostly a thing of the (recent) past, but they are still worth mentioning here because they are a reflection of bad things have become. For those who don't know, a no co-broke listing is a listing in which the listing agent declares upfront that they will not share the broker fee with the tenant's agent.

 If I had a client who requested to visit a no co-broke property, the listing agent refused to show the property if I (as an agent) was the one who requested the tour. Not only was this unfair to these tenants, it was also unfair to the landlord because they were potentially missing out on some very good tenants. In other words, the listing agents clearly put their own interests above the interests of the landlords by listing these properties as no co-brokes. (Note: some of these listing agents were also the owners, but since owners in general are not allowed to collect broker fees from tenants, this doesn't justify anything.)

 **The Last Month's Rent Scam**

Agents aren't the only people who behave badly. Every time tenants complain that charging both last month's rent AND a security deposit is excessive, landlords will immediately push back (as loudly as possible) with claims that it's necessary to do so for their own protection. And I get that…when you're dealing with tenants with bad credit who are renting out low-end apartments. But landlords don't stop there: they also (as a rule) require last month rent's from all clients, even if they are VIP clients with stellar credit.

One main benefit of doing this is that it amounts to an interest-free loan for the landlord. In the meantime, the landlord is depriving the tenant of utilizing the money, which rightfully still belongs to the tenant. Another possible reason for grabbing last month's rent is that some of these landlords are attempting to steal this rent payment altogether. Consider the fact that many of the wealthier clients have housing allowances, and others have their rent paid for them directly via the company. This makes these clients prime targets for double paying last month's rent at the end of the year because they have forgotten that the last month has already been paid for.

**Security Deposit Theft**

Most people are aware that some landlords try to deduct bogus charges from a security deposit simply because they can get away with it. But it's also not uncommon for landlords to steal the security deposit altogether. I remember one tenant (not my client) who never got their deposit (of $8000) back because the landlord ghosted the client. This type of theft is easy to pull off if the landlord lives overseas and doesn't put the money in a local bank (as required by state law).

**Lead paint disclosure fiasco**

The lead paint disclosure is a disaster, and the main blame falls on the state legislature for coming up with this nonsense. First of all, by requiring a lead paint disclosure, most landlords refuse to test their houses for lead paint because doing so is a liability. They would rather allow their tenants to live in houses where the likely presence of lead paint is unconfirmed rather than deal with the dread of admitting to prospective tenants that their property has tested positive for lead paint.

 The biggest problem with the current laws is that they have resulted in blatant discrimination against families with small children. The current law states that if a family with children 6 or under moves into a property, the landlord must test that property. If the property has lead paint, the owner is obligated to spend thousands of dollars to de-lead the property before move-in (regardless of whether the landlord can afford it.)

 If MA was serious about protecting children, it would financially help landlords to remove lead paint. Instead, the financial obligation is placed on the landlords, which has most often led to the following situations:

1. The landlord simply ignores the requirement to test a house when small children move in.
2. The landlord does not accept a tenant's application based on the fact that they have small children.

That said, there is that (rare) occurrence when the landlord does de-lead the home before the tenants move in. As a result, the tenants are forced to find (and pay for) temporary housing during the de-leading process, which is also a huge inconvenience.

 The main reason for mentioning lead paint in this confession list is because listing agents play a major role in enabling the landlords to discriminate against families with small children, and it is a regular occurrence.

 **Award for Worst Behavior**

Of all the agents I've worked with over the years, one in particular stands out. Unethical actions included:

1. Aggressively claiming during price negotiations that the landlord would never accept such a price, only to discover that the agent was the landlord (which should have been disclosed). At that point, I found it a little awkward having to listen to her talk about herself in 3rd person. (No, I never mentioned to her that I knew: I don't ""show my cards"" unless it is in my client's best interests to do so.)
2. Stealth-editing the listing for the unit after my client's application had been approved to increase the amount that the client was required to pay upfront. (The initially required payments were clearly stated on the approved application.)
3. Instructing my client to pay her (i.e. the listing agent's) broker fee directly into her personal bank account so her broker wouldn't take a commission.

So yeah, well done my friend. You deserve a round of applause.

 **BROKER FEE ""BAN"" FOLLOWUP**

There was a lot of discussion about the potential consequences of changing the broker fee law, and we are starting to see the actual results now.  Here are some of the consequences I've already noticed:

**Resorting to Bribery**

Many people predicted that landlords would raise rent prices to cover the fees. So far, I haven't seen clear evidence of this occurring. On the contrary, due to weaker-than usual demand, prices this year are either holding steady or even dropping a bit. But that hasn't stopped agents with finding ways to ""outsmart"" the new law. For example, I had a client who applied for a unit at the listed price. The listing agent counter-offered with a higher rent price to cover her broker fee. In other words: the listing agent told my clients that if they wanted to be accepted, they had to pay her broker fee.

**The Moment of Truth for Landlords has Arrived**

 Anecdotal evidence suggests that some landlords who've worked with agents in the past are now choosing to find tenants themselves rather than pay a listing agent. Although this not a surprise, it does confirm that these landlords - who had no problem with forcing their tenants to pay broker fees - are unwilling to pay the fees themselves.

 **Listing Agents are Scrambling**

The sudden change in the law has left some listing agents scrambling to figure out how to get paid. Since August 1st, multiple listing agents have asked me directly if the relocation company was paying my fee. (No, they do not.)  I'm not sure why they were asking, but the implication is that they wanted to charge my clients if my fee was already covered by a 3rd party.

 Another thing agents appear to be doing is pretending to NOT be the listing agent, which is something agents can potentially get away with by posting listings on sites like Zillow. (That's actually genius guys, good luck.)

Additionally, it would be remiss of me not to point out that there are real estate agencies in the Boston area who have built their entire business model on offering exclusive no co-broke listings. (OK, maybe there is just one, and everybody who knows the rental market knows exactly who I'm talking about.) To skirt around the law, their website calls their broker fee a ""rental fee."" In my opinion, this makes a mockery out of the new law, but then again…what are these agents supposed to do?

 **The People Have Had Enough**

The demand for agents appears to have plummeted overnight. Even my clients who get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year don't want to pay for an agent if given the choice. And while none of this is surprising, people in general are not yet willing to recognize that agents do provide a valuable (even if overpriced) service.

For example, the clients that requested we tour 30 properties would never consider scheduling so many options on their own. And those clients who rode in my car as we toured properties in Boston will opt to take public transportation while touring ""solo."" People will miss good rental opportunities because they are not familiar with the market. House finding will take longer, and be more confusing without an agent to answer questions about the rental process. Yes, agents do provide a service…which at this time appears to be both overpriced and undervalued.

 **THE RENTAL MARKET SLOWDOWN**

This year there was a noticeable shift in the market: the summer season - which is usually highly competitive -  fell flat, leading many to believe that renters were waiting until August to avoid the broker fee. But the anticipated August rush never materialized, suggesting that something else had tampered with the market. One likely theory - based on the fact that ""student housing"" demand was hit hard - is that the cancellation with student visas has had a significant impact on the Boston market. And while that may be a one-off, the H1B visa changes threaten to make an even bigger impact.

Unlike L1 work visas (which import workers the U.S. feels are worthy of becoming American citizens), the H1B visa is used to temporarily import foreign labor as cheap replacements for their local counterparts. Since the year 2020, over 1.3 MILLION H1B visas have been granted. Frankly, I don't think people are even aware of how many of H1B visas holders are in the Boston area. To give an example, a client remarked that 4 out 5 people in of his department in the Boston area was here on H1B visas.

 While the hope is that H1B visa changes will help the job market locally, I think companies are more likely to simply return to hiring employees abroad. And *this* could have a significant impact on housing affordability in the Boston area (unlike the broker fee change, which long-term doesn't impact housing prices at all in my opinion).

 I don't know what the numbers are for the number of undocumented immigrants in the Boston area, and how many are leaving or getting deported. However, it is possible that the immigration policies of the current administration could also impact housing in the Boston area depending on the number of people who ultimately leave.

**ON A LIGHTER NOTE**

 I don't want to end on a negative note, so I decided to drop this in here:

 **Best Views in Boston**

 I've toured most of the high rises in Boston (many times over) and have seen some incredible views. My two personal favorites views are:

* East India Row towers (condo buildings)
* Devonshire (apartment complex)

 Coincidentally, neither of these properties offers in-unit laundry (which is a dealbreaker for some clients). The laundry for East India is in the basement, while Devonshire offers shared laundry rooms on every other floor. (There are exceptions: some of the East India units have added in-unit laundry, and the penthouse units in Devonshire have in-unit laundry as well.)

In another odd coincidence. my two favorite Boston pools are at Devonshire and East India. Devonshire has an amazing indoor pool on the 42nd floor, with sunset views of Boston Common and Back Bay. Meanwhile, East India has an outdoor pool with a large private area right on Boston Harbor.

They gave me a temporary NH license plate that is good for 7 days and told me they cannot handle the Mass license plate transfer because it is an EV one, I need to do it myself. Their instructions were vague like “I don’t really know, go to the RMV in MA.” They registered my car and did an RTA for me, and told me new Massachusetts license plates (but not for an EV, just MA regular plates) will be coming in the mail to me this week.

My question is: as a Massachusetts resident, how do I transfer my EV Mass license plates from my prior owned EV car to my new leased EV car? And since I allegedly have Massachusetts license plates coming to me in the mail, do I need to wait until I receive those before I can go to the RMV, or can I go to the RMV now with my RTA, proof of insurance, Mass REAL ID, and current EV plates that are off the old car now while the NH temporary plates are on there? And any idea if I need to fill out a second RTA or some form asking for the plate transfer?

I cannot find a straight answer anywhere.

Basically I'm selling my car privately and the person trying to buy it is saying we don't *need* the title transfer in order to make the sale. We only need to sign the bill of sale and he needs to insure it. 

I had paid off my title loan just last week and my lien holder was going to process it within 5 business days and send it to the RMV. It's an electronic title if that helps. 

  
I'm not really getting straight answers from all my searches so the main Q is this. 

  
If I sell him my car without any of the title transfer documentation and just a bill of sale will I still be on the hook in some way? Would I still need to do the title transfer documentation in the future when the title arrive (I would think so) or would he be able to get the title transferred to him with proof of sale?

I’ve been renting in Ashland since 2022. I started my first year at $2200/month, the next year increased to $2300, then the next was $2500 for a 2 bed/2 bath. When it was time to renew this past spring they offered me $2300/month both via email and in the lease itself, which I was really surprised by and did not question. I signed the lease immediately and paid the $2300 rate in both August and September.

I then got an automated email from the apartment app last week saying I had $400 in past due fees. I forwarded the email to the management office asking for clarification, and they responded: 

“Our apologies, It appears the renewal was sent based off your original rent. The renewal should have been to REMAIN at current rent of $2500.  We are happy to forget August/Sept  if we could please adjust to rent of $2500 moving forward in October The owner does not decrease rent but rather intended it to remain the same. Our apologies as the system had a glitch and went off your security deposit not the rent.

We can resend the form to adjust for that. Apologies, we will be reaching out to the vendor to ensure that this is addressed asap.”

I am SO INFURIATED. We both signed a legal document MONTHS AGO, and my security deposit was $2200 not $2300 so I don’t believe that story. I might be less angry if this management company wasn’t so terrible at baseline but they are. I’ve stayed because it’s a nice building in a great location and it’s cheaper to pay $100-200 more a month than it is to move but this might be the final straw for me. 

Are they not legally obligated to honor the lease we signed? They’re talking like this is some easy fix I’d have no issue with. I assume if I push back though, they won’t renew me and I’ll end up having to move next summer, so I’m weighing that risk too, even though I’d love to respond tearing them a new one and cc the owner.

* £22 per cone (x2 = £44)

There has been plenty of criticism about the lack of enforcement of traffic laws, and lots of other complaints about police blowing off citizens concerns. These all seem like legitimate concerns. There also seem to be some interesting community engagement initiatives and goals about lowering. But beyond the five year strategic plan for 2016-2020, I see nothing about there actual strategies and priorities online. 

Also, who is responsible for police oversight? I mean both for the small things like cops parking personal cars anywhere, with their ticket pads used as defacto permits (this is what motivated this post…), to the big issues like potential corruption or excessive use of force. I’m not saying this is happening (except the parking thing of course) but curious what the process is.
