When I dealt with an actual person, their info went into the person/email/phone fields. The status field keeps track of where you are in the process, and I would color the boxes green for positive states like ""moving forward"" and red for ""rejected"".

The drawbacks of MA are real and are difficult, there‚Äôs no question. 

But it is also a state (and a region) where *most* people politically and socially fundamentally understand and value the fact that we‚Äôre all stuck here together, we should make it as good as it *can* be, together, since we‚Äôre stuck here.

Other areas do not behave this way at all and living in those states is miserable. Those states believe ‚Äúyou are here for yourself, fend for yourself and yourself alone.‚Äù They are antisocial states with antisocial values and miserable people.

It never matters ‚Äúhow nice the weather is‚Äù if everybody despises everybody.

FWIiW we were trapped in Florida, then made it to NC for a short period prior to making it here. The weather in Florida is horrible for 10 months of the year. Other people like it because they think summer is nice on a winter vacation. But it is unliveable and quite literally not sustainable given climate change. The only way to make it a safe temperature for 10 months is cranking out AC everywhere there, which just increases the climate impact, which makes it hotter, which‚Ä¶. Yeah. 

I also believe that people drastically underestimate how expensive these places are. You‚Äôre saving money on taxes and tax burdens- yes. But you get nothing from that in terms of services and protections, *and* everything else is essentially as expensive if not more than in many other major US cities. 

True story: we moved to central Florida from NYC. We had a car in NYC and drove it down there: our insurance *doubled.* You‚Äôd think it would be cheaper because of all of those ‚Äúcheaper state‚Äù things. But in Florida, the insurance adjusters know that Florida drivers are notoriously awful and unpredictable, and that more than 50% of the accidents are caused by uninsured drivers (and something like 30% are suspended or non license holders).

I fully agree with your coworker. I vividly recall Katrina and watching the suffering across Louisiana and Texas, with so many people moving post-evacuation. The tornadoes and hurricanes hitting Texas and the lack of basic state-like FEMA services (not to mention the grid shut-downs) really pushed me out as a young adult. I also grew up in similar conditions to this young woman. Oh, and the harassment and cat-calling‚Äîit was normal growing up‚Äîand by disgusting grown men. I only experienced it in NYC since I live in the northeast. Haven‚Äôt since moving upstate and working across New England, though.

The first time I heard people complain in NYC about issues with Medicaid, SNAP, or any other service, including state weather services (we had close to no recovery services in the South‚Äîonly limited help from FEMA), I was so shocked. We don‚Äôt have access to ANY of this in the South. The fact that I suddenly and totally unexpectedly had food and healthcare access while in school changed my life. I didn‚Äôt have to work so hard; I could focus on my studies.

I no longer need the services; we are fortunate to live comfortably now. But I will GLADLY pay more in taxes until the day that I die so other young people or just folks in need have basic services. And to ensure we collectively have support as a state/ region in case of a natural disaster.

To live in the south is to live among people who do not value fundamental human rights and dignity‚Äîit‚Äôs everyone for themselves. People live with a poverty tax, making it very expensive to live there, which folks don‚Äôt realize on paper. Food and healthcare for young adults in college or master's school? ‚ÄúNo, get a real job! And we don‚Äôt care that your lack of healthcare will have long-term implications!‚Äù Single moms struggling? ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt have had children! And no, you don‚Äôt have access to reproductive healthcare!‚Äù.

It‚Äôs different in the Northeast. I wouldn‚Äôt say the entire North because I lived on the West Coast for a short period, and they didn‚Äôt have basic services there either‚Äîpart of why the Northeast/ New England was so shocking to me.

The Northeast/ New England has its problems, for sure. But these problems are fundamentally different than living in the south. I miss living in the south, but it‚Äôs gotten so much worse since I left. I don‚Äôt believe I would be safe there anymore. Grateful to live in NYS and work around New England‚Äîand I‚Äôve long spent a lot of time in Massachusetts‚Äîit‚Äôs a good place.

Connecticut's laws just aren't as progressive as Massachusetts. As a lawyer it was really cool to go down to the old state house in Boston common and be sworn into the bar in the same room where America drew its first breath of liberty, sign my name on the same roll as some of the famed founding fathers and influential lawyers. I think some of those traditions carry on in Mass in the form of government and justice systems that actually care about the people in the state and the state itself. Commonwealth isn't just part of the name. Meanwhile, Connecticut is the land of steady habits, the insurance capital of the world, and a haven for old monied families who specifically rejected Boston as being too liberal. 

In Massachusetts, for example, if the car insurance company wants to raise your rates because of an at fault accident, the policyholder has the right to a hearing in front of a court officer where fault can be disputed, even in the case where the driver is sighted, and where it seemed to me that as long as a warm body showed up to contest the rate change. The officer would always deny the insurance company's request. In Connecticut, the insurance company just raises the premium and there is nothing you can do. The Massachusetts consumer protection statute 93a is a model of pro consumer legislation and one of the things for which Mass earned the reputation of ""so goes Mass, so goes the nation,"" same with Mass workers comp. laws, which favor the injured worker over the employer and insurer. Even if you never have an accident, consumer complaint, or work injury, every person in mass benefits daily from these progressive laws. Should be a source of pride for every Masshole. üòú

The other major difference is that CT lacks that world-class City which goes hand in hand with an international airport, large venues, mass transit, professional sports, etc., related construction and infrastructure jobs. Boston is the destination in New England, not some place people are just passing through. You can feel it in all aspects of policy and services.

Some parts of it literally look like you might more expect to see in a poor area of Africa (and yes, I've been to Africa and seen poor areas there, I am not saying that for hyperbole). Especially the amount of racial inequality down there - there are still literal sundown towns, and towns that are literally mansions on one side of a railway track and shacks on the other - guess the racial composition of each?

Also, she's not joking about the weather. 100% humidity starts about May and lasts until anywhere from September to November, where it's >100F for at least 4 months out of that, with intermittent monsoon-level downpours.

The safety thing too.

1nbkzpt,I have a coworker would grew up in Louisiana and said she would never move back down south or anywhere with few government services.,massachusetts,nd4e2p7,AchillesDev,"My wife was born and raised (in poverty) in the south. Me, my mom, and my brother were priced out of fucking central MA in the late 90s and moved to north Florida. I grew up there, while coming back to MA for summers and holidays to stay with my dad, and lived there for 20 years before finally being able to make it back to MA.

I completely agree. I'd never go back. My Latina wife? Absolutely never going back (we've lived in Boston for ~8 years now). We begrudgingly go back once every 1 or 2 years for a week or so to see my mom (she comes up here much more) and her nieces, and that's about it. I'd never move back, and the boomers who move there are clueless and the ones I know get pretty quickly disillusioned.

> She laughed at the suggestion that there‚Äôs any place in Massachusetts that‚Äôs ‚Äúrough‚Äù

I went to elementary school in main south in Worcester in the 90s, and go into Roxbury and Dorchester all the time today, and hard agree. The roughest parts have nothing on even the middle class parts of much of the south. And Jacksonville in the 90s and early 00s? Forget about it.

> that lots of natives move down South because of the cheaper cost of living and nicer weather. She was aghast. ‚ÄúNicer weather? It‚Äôs sticky most of the time!‚Äù Cheaper cost of living? ‚ÄúIt was on the backs of people making federal minimum wage!‚Äù

She's right, and the boomers that move there don't contribute to the economy, use local resources, and because they have no skin in the game, fight against education and infrastructure funding tooth and nail. Not that these places were paradises (or even very good) to begin with, but the brainwormed boomers that moved to the south were a big factor in purplish Florida going red.

> She told me she would never move to a place like NH after having grown up in the South. She said she didn‚Äôt want to move to a place with ‚Äúfew government services‚Äù or ‚Äúpeople who didn‚Äôt value them‚Äù.

Hard agree.

> Having heard a southerner‚Äôs endorsement of this state makes me reconsider my complaints about this state‚Ä¶

I used to get into it a lot with people here who have these illusions that the south is some sort of racial and/or worker's paradise and people are just held in thrall by Republicans that nobody apparently votes for. It's an incredibly naive view of things, and spending an appreciable time anywhere in the south (except maybe Atlanta) will rapidly disabuse you of that notion and make you appreciate how good we really have it in MA.

I was born in the MS Delta, my grandparents had a farm on the MS river. I‚Äôve lived in MS, AR, VA and NC. The majority of my life was spent in MS and AR. 

I moved to upstate NY in 2002 with my job. It was an internal opening I applied for. We planned to stay for 3-5 years and then I planned to promote again. But once we got here and discovered how much better it was than where we‚Äôd been, we decided to stay. 

My son was 3. Shortly after moving he was diagnosed with PDD and then later ASD. The district we were in held a meeting, created his IEP and he started receiving services immediately. And he had a LOT of services thrown at him. My BFF in AR was a special education teacher and she was stunned when she read his IEP because of the amount of services he was receiving. 

There is no comparison between southern states and the NE. People often asked me why I moved and my standard answer was the weather. They scoffed at that. Then I explained that living in upper 90s and low 100s for months, with high humidity, was not comfortable. My kids hated playing outside in the summer. If you didn‚Äôt have a pool or live on a lake it was miserable. And that was for the kids. Adults can‚Äôt live in a wet swim suit all summer. 

The local public schools were not good. Tax increases for schools were NEVER approved so public schools had minimal resources. My husband volunteered in my daughter‚Äôs classroom every week. He created a music program for 2nd graders with toy instruments he found at garage sales and percussion instruments her made himself with trash, ex: empty 35mm film canisters with pebbles. The school had no money for a music teacher or instruments. Other teachers begged him to volunteer in their classroom. 

Is it cheaper? Yes. But people pay $10K+/year to send their children to private schools. Why? Because they don‚Äôt want their children in class with black children.

Also on the whole, ""on the backs of those who make fed min wage"" bit... yeah...

Used cars in good condition were worth about as much as a new car and on top of that prices never fully recovered before covid destroyed supply chains. So making fed min wage (7.25) you are required to own a bit of machinery that cost $200 a month to insure in parts of the state and cost like 11 years ago $15000 for a lightly used toyota corolla.

‚Ä¢ i was in a LDR with someone who's from Louisiana.

1nbkzpt,I have a coworker would grew up in Louisiana and said she would never move back down south or anywhere with few government services.,massachusetts,nd5j203,evoltap,"Well, I will offer an alternate perspective. I grew up in rural western MA with back to the land hippies. Lived in the pioneer valley in my early 20s. I love a lot about the region and people, and visit often. I moved to Austin almost 20 years ago, and now live in a rural town about 40 minutes outside. I have friends from all over Texas and have traveled the state extensively as well as the south east (and whole country) touring in a band. 

When I told people in MA I was moving to Texas, they acted like I was moving to Mordor. Without getting into all the details, let me just say that the biggest thing I‚Äôve learned living in both places is that people who have only lived in one don‚Äôt know WTF they are talking about and are heavily propagandized about the ‚Äúother‚Äù place. Do I want to live in Alabama? No, but I can tell you I‚Äôve seen positive things there that don‚Äôt get fed to those living in the blue states. The healing of racism of the past is actively happening in those southern states, and the way the propaganda machine paints it to the blue state residents is NOT helping. I grew up in a predominately white community in MA, and am sickened now by how I see people in those communities judge places like where I live. I am married to a Mexican American, and she shares my perspective on that. Central Texas is a very diverse place, and rural Texas is also very diverse (as in three major groups). Many would be surprised how well everybody gets along, and actual racism is very rarely seen‚Äî like we are just not thinking about it, we just live together completely integrated. 

So here‚Äôs the real unpopular opinion that will have you going for the downvote button if you weren‚Äôt already: the best places to live are where conservatism and liberalism live together in a sort of healthy tension. That is central Texas, and having lived in MA, I will absolutely choose this. It took me some time to come to that position, and it‚Äôs worth noting that I have voted for Nader and Bernie in my life, but now feel that I have a much broader perspective that informs me that their positions are not what I think society needs.

As long as you vote for measures and politicians who support things like equal treatment under the law, access to food & housing, access to healthcare, and the necessary taxes to support all these things, pretty much anyone is welcome. 

I won't pretend that Massachusetts is flawless. We have our issues. Our politicians have a history of nepotism and double-dealing, and then not being held accountable, but we've been improving in these regards lately. We've been trying to get our state's legislature to be more transparent with their processes, and that's been a helluva fight. We have our own unique form of racism that has made multiple POC friends of mine move *back* to the deep south to gate away from (up here, the racists will pretend to be progressive while doing everything they can to undermine the minorities they hate. They'll never call you a slur, but they'll set you up to look like the incompetent bad guy at your place of work if you're not careful). And while the vast majority of people in this state are anti-gun, our gun laws are so confusing and contradictory that no one is quite sure what is and is not legal to own right now, and our state is currently getting sued in federal court over it (and the Boston Bar Association has published a couple of blog posts stating that they expect at least some of our gun laws to get repealed, and potentially more if it goes up to SCOTUS).

Take all this as you will. I grew up here, and I would be hard pressed to want to ever move away. But we're not flawless and have things we need to work on. Anyone who wants to help us continue to work on them is always welcome in my book, regardless of where they came from.",1757347599.0,2025-09-08T12:06:39,22,t1_nd3fof4,False

Other driving observations (it took getting used to being born and raised a masshole):

- People don‚Äôt let people go out of nicety.

He was seen at one of the largest hospitals in the state, and we knew from the beginning we‚Äôd demand a move to MGH just because of location. But the resident almost immediately told him they‚Äôd be transferring him to MGB because they didn‚Äôt have the medical knowledge to deal with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Which great! They know their limits! ‚Ä¶EDS is something they should encounter frequently enough it shouldn‚Äôt by itself be a reason to hand off to another hospital, not to mention bypassing the closer hospital at Dartmouth. But they were adamant he wouldn‚Äôt get proper care there. 

It turned out they also missed four of his broken ribs and several of the secondary breaks in his ankle, so moving him was a good idea just based on the lack of diagnostic ability, but it was also a scary insight into NH‚Äôs medical system. 
 
And that‚Äôs not even getting into the issue with Catholic hospitals being common up there. üòê",1757353673.0,2025-09-08T13:47:53,3,t1_nd2ydpo,False

I'm from Philly and it blew my mind when I met (sold them some lumber) my first ""truly free black man and family"" living by the sweat of their brows in a ranch house on 10 acres. 

It's hard to understand this if you don't know history and Philly and all of that. But this has nothing to do with white folks ""letting"" them be this way - it is the result of a small amount of ""property"", something black folks elsewhere have a very hard time getting ahold of.

I found similar in the 1990's near Hilton Head where a large black family had members who moved back (w/skills and a little money) from NYC, etc. - they still had some land, so made lots and were building and selling little new houses.

Proof positive, IMHO, that inclusion in terms of property and income, etc. IS really the ONLY problem.",1757340698.0,2025-09-08T10:11:38,7,t1_nd2qp3x,False

* Getting rid of winter fuel payments to pensioners

* Continuing the ongoing destruction of the NHS
* Xenophobic and anti-refugee immigration policies

>And re: MA gun laws‚Ä¶yes they are confusing to me esp as someone who isn‚Äôt a lawyer. Personally, I am always on guard as a Floridian due to the lax/stupid gun laws. The amount of people who shoot and kill each other here over road rage shit or disputes terrifies me. Also, the prevalence of school shootings. 

>That‚Äôs not to say that those things can‚Äôt happen in MA, but it seems far less likely by comparison. After the Pulse shooting in Orlando, I didn‚Äôt go out to any gay clubs or bars for over a year and I have a memorial tattoo because the proceeds went to the victims. In FL I am constantly hyper vigilant in every public space because at any moment I‚Äôm afraid of a mass shooting, even in the grocery store.

Oh, certainly.

Personally, I'm very pro-2A (armed minorities are harder to oppress), but acknowledge it should be limited in some ways. But common sense things like licensing, background checks for crimes and domestic abuse, requiring private sales to check & report transactions the same way an FFL is, requiring and subsidizing safe storage of guns, banning certain calibers, (IIRC, MA bans 50 caliber rifle rounds), etc. And, generally, my attitude is anything the police are allowed to have, civilians should be, too; if it's too dangerous for a civilian, it's too dangerous for a cop.

The issue is that this isn't what we really have.

Our licensing is restrictive, and it's often easier to get if you live in an affluent town: state law requires the process to take no more than 40 days; I live in a wealthy suburb of Boston and got mine in 29 days; if you live in Boston-proper, it takes 12-24 months. The state got rid of our gun registration portal when they overhauled our gun laws, but never replaced it like they said they would, so nothing is getting reported right now. The state said they're putting together a list of all guns banned after 8/1/24, but have yet to actually publish that list, so you could buy a gun today and learn tomorrow that you're now a felon because the state finally punished their list. And the gun bans don't apply to cops, even if they're purchasing for their own use (and, if I heard correctly, they can retransfer these guns, creating a temptation for cops to be straw buyers). Some guns are plainly banned via a relatively simple feature test, and others are both explicitly banned and not-banned by the same test (lever actions are always allowed, guns that have AR-15 mag ports are always banned, but there are lever actions that are fed via AR-15 mags: are these guns banned or not?). Our list of officially approved locking devices is outdated, limited, and doesn't include a single safe or container (only trigger and chamber locks)

It's a rats nest of laws that seeks to make people feel like they're effective, while leaving massive loopholes, pitfalls, and unequal access.

Imo, MA's lack of mass shootings and violent crime just in general isn't thanks to our gun laws, but to our robust social safety nets, social services, and quality of life just in general. As long as we continue to protect, support, and develop these aspects of our state, I believe we'll continue to enjoy a peaceful life - regardless of what state our gun laws are in.",1757510447.0,2025-09-10T09:20:47,2,t1_nd57zni,False

1) Do you have a primary care doctor yet? Calling around to try to get in with the big integrated care systems will get you access to more doctors who may have different schedules or office locations, plus you‚Äôll know they take your insurance and can often refer to specialists more quickly than if you‚Äôre cold calling. (That said, a two-month wait to see an endocrinologist isn‚Äôt bad for the Boston area, and if you want to see a therapist first, you‚Äôll probably appreciate the lead time.)

1nkjo42,Thank you to the Health & Environment Committee!,CambridgeMA,nf220yg,SaveTheAlewifeBrook,"Disagree. I was at that hearing and spoke about how I got sick from untreated sewage floodwater. Never before have I felt more heard and more cared for. The Councillors sincerely care! The city‚Äôs planning work is hindered by MWRA. The MWRA is getting in the way of progress for a few reasons. One, they use the Alewife Brook as a sewer and want to keep doing that. They do not care about community health. Two, the Boston Harbor Court case is still open because of MWRA‚Äôs failure to comply with the court. This means that MWRA is still on the hook for paying for work! If you‚Äôve been to the meetings, then you know MWRA is trying to change the modeling to allow for a 26% increase in sewage pollution in the rivers. The watershed advocates and the public has been pressing MWRA for sewer separation and green stormwater infrastructure. But MWRA is not allowing this approach in their regulatory mandate to put together a plan. The MWRA has over a million households in its 43 sewer communities. 35% of the sewage flow comes from non-residential (think: businesses). Do the math on a 40 year tax-free bond at 5.5%. The cost comes out to around ten cents per household per day to fund a billion dollars. We don‚Äôt actually know the real cost at Alewife Brook because the project planners haven‚Äôt provided the public with the projects that the public wants to see: sewer separation, Green stormwater infrastructure, and a 25-year level of control. And this is why we need awesome legislators to step in and stand up to MWRA.",1758283502.0,2025-09-19T08:05:02,2,t1_nf0ek4k,True

1nkjo42,Thank you to the Health & Environment Committee!,CambridgeMA,nf4i5ak,SaveTheAlewifeBrook,"The project planners are now four years into the planning. We'd need to see plans that include elimination of the sewage pollution. The cost per user will be less expensive if MWRA pays for it because they have  lot of users. We‚Äôve done research on MWRA‚Äôs ability to pay. The state‚Äôs funding mechanism for CSO control has been primarily through an increase in MWRA water and sewer rates.

¬†MWRA has over a million households in the 43 municipalities that use its sewer service. 35% of the flows are from non-residential users - think: businesses. A 40-year tax-free bond that MWRA uses to fund projects would carry a 5.5% interest rate.

We don't know the costs for Cambridge because we haven't seen plans with costs for complete elimination of Cambridge CSOs. We haven't even seen plans for sewer separation or Green Stormwater Infrastructure in Cambridge.

But in Somerville, we've seen a plan that includes elimination of Somerville's Tannery Brook sewage outfall (SOM001A). The cost of that plan is around $90 million. If MWRA absorbs all of Somerville‚Äôs cost for a $90 million project to close SOM001A, as suggested by their consultant Dewberry,¬†then MWRA‚Äôs wholesale sewer rates per household go up something like $3.65 per household, annually.

Given the moderators misquote I think it‚Äôs hard to tell what the question was but I thought it was in reference to 18 story building and I agree because normally bees don‚Äôt fly over 40ft.,1757652472.0,2025-09-12T00:47:52,0,t1_ndofl0m,False

1nec6tj,Report from ABC City Council Candidate Forum at the Cambridge Senior Center 9/10/2025,CambridgeMA,ndpoty0,BiteProud,"They said raised, not raise. Lots of people raised families on a lot less before the housing crisis.  It's also why Zusy saying she used to rent and make $17k/year long ago comes across as so out of touch when she didn't include what she paid in rent then. It really just wasn't that long ago that with no kids and no student debt, you could rent for a few years on that kind of money and be alright. 

Now if you make 5x that you can't live alone without being rent burdened. Now if you make $85k and live with roommates all through your twenties, have a college degree but no significant student loan debt, have a partner that also does okay, and have family help with the down payment you might be able to save up to buy a house someday somewhere that isn't Cambridge.",1757628374.0,2025-09-11T18:06:14,6,t1_ndon0aw,False
