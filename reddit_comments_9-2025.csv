In a big apt building in Cambridge. 

Signed a renewal lease in June, they miss-priced my apt and didn’t include the charge for parking, but lease clearly states I continue to get parking.

A few weeks later I go on the portal and the executed lease is the original, lesser amount signed by mgmt and the newer lease was never signed by them.

1nrd6og,Confessions of a Boston (Rental) Real Estate Agent,boston,nghqhtv,WhataGongShow2020,"Thank you so much for this post. it really sheds some light. 

Context: I would have been one of those folks who would have hired your services before August. Family of 4 with two toddlers moving from LA to Boston.

Company just paid for us to fly out for a week and house hunt. We lined up 4-6 showings per day, learned a ton, and ultimately came back to LA without securing a home. But we're now confident in areas we like, what to look for in listings. 

On one hand, house hunting from LA is challenging, just using zillow or realtor.com. On the other hand, the thought of shelling out another $5k to hire an agent is not feeling great. So the question for you is. What value would an agent such as yourself bring in this situation. Value that I don't get from browsing listings myself? Now, I'm at the point of waiting for listings, verifying more info, including a video walk through, and then flying across the country on my own dime to tour in person. 


I think based on your post, I did things backward. Listed a house, no lead certificate. We told the agent we'd apply if they confirmed no lead. Of course, they didn't do any testing. So, should we have just applied first and IF accepted, then demanded the test? Or is the more reality-based assumption that even if we applied, they wouldn't select us due to 2 kids under 6, and we just burned a few bucks on application fees?

Ps. This is valuable info to me. Send me your venmo, and I'll buy you a coffee for your time 😀

We've also noticed tons of price drops, near q4 expected slow down, immigration slowdown (I was H1B, no chance I'd enter this country right now if these shenanigans were going on 20 years ago.) It's brought some areas slightly into our price range, granted its the worst house in the neighborhood but $5k for a 3-4 Br in Wellesley I'm guessing is near unheard of, right?

Thanks for the insight and your time, cheers.",1758986324.0,2025-09-27T11:18:44,3,t3_1nrd6og,False

Send them a demand letter (look up the requirements) via certified mail with 30 day notice to remedy the situation. Ask for a refund of anything paid above original amount and then acknowledgement of the original lease terms.

Say if this issue is not cured within 30 days you will be pursuing the matter in small claims court and may be entitled to triple damages under Chapter 93a.

1nrd6og,Confessions of a Boston (Rental) Real Estate Agent,boston,ngim4fo,boston-area-agent,"Hi, welcome to Boston!

Just a note: on August 1, my fee dropped to 1/2 month the rent price (to reflect the fact that the listing agent isn't taking a 50% cut). The idea - in my perspective - was that part of the reason that the broker fee was unreasonable was because the tenant was paying two agents. I don't think locals would go for even a 1/2 month fee, but potentially there is value for people transferring into the area. 

Here are some benefits of using my services:

**Virtual tours:** Good units are often snapped up quickly (although this more applicable to the summer months), so virtual tours can help secure a great property without worrying that it will be gone before your next house-finding trip.

**Scheduling tours:** This is especially helpful for busy people who don't have time to waste. Just give me blocks of time when you're available and I'll schedule your list of properties in the most efficient manner possible. This is especially important for people looking to move into the city: I take into account traffic, time to find parking, time to walk from parking, how long it will take to view a certain unit, etc.

**Support with Applications:** I make the application process quick and simple, while also creating an application packet for the landlord that is very presentable and well-organized.  

**Lease negotiations and review:** I’m experienced with handling rent price negotiations, will provide you with a review of the lease (including landlord verification), and will answer any questions you have about the lease terms.

**Auto MLS updates:** Although it’s possible to get updates from other websites, the MLS offers the most filters for fine-tuning a search.

**Area recommendations:** For people who aren't sure where they want to live, I can give recommendations for things like: good schools, locations near public transport, peaceful vs. lively neighborhoods, pros and cons of living in a certain area, etc.

To answer your questions:

**The Lead Paint Issue**:

A landlord will never test their house for lead paint unless forced to do so, because once lead paint is found in the house, this is a matter of public record and the landlord will have to disclose the presence of lead paint to every tenant that rents the property.

But if you try to go the other route and apply first, you will most likely be asked the ages of your children (as it’s on most standard rental applications).

Thus, if you apply for a house and the status of lead paint is unknown (which is still the majority of the properties in the area), your applications will most likely be denied based on the fact that you have small children. You won’t be told this, but that will be the real reason. (The only reason I say “most” is because upon occasion a landlord is willing to de-lead the house, especially if renovations are already occurring and the start date is a couple months out.)

**Price Drops**

The Boston area is a summer market, so the small landlords will always end their leases in the summer months when possible (by August 31). It’s probably every Boston area landlord’s worst nightmare to be sitting with an empty house after school starts, so this is the perfect time to catch a good deal on a rental. The caveat here is that there are no restrictions on rent increases for the Boston market, so if you do find a good deal the landlord will most likely want to get the rent back up to “market price” when the unit comes up for renewal.

**One final comment**

If you are looking on generic sites such as zillow and realtor, you will have to be careful because the person you contact could try to squeeze a fee out of you. To clarify: only the listing agent is not allowed to charge you a fee, but there is no guarantee that the person you contact via these sites is the listing agent. (Obviously, this only applies to properties that have a listing agent.)",1758995913.0,2025-09-27T13:58:33,2,t1_nghqhtv,True

The clients I worked with needed agents because they weren't from the Boston area and didn't have a clue where to look. For many of them, their employers paid their fee.

1nqojiz,new resident - transferring car out of state to MA for residence permit,boston,ng8k2g8,vampirenthusiast162,"Congrats on your move! I also moved to Massachusetts recently and had to transfer my title. Here’s what I did: 

First, I had to find an insurance agent near me, and I asked for some car insurance quotes. He sent some to me, I picked one, and then he sent me some paperwork I had to sign. 

I had to bring that paperwork, my license, my title, and my registration to an RMV near me. I can’t quite remember if they just took my real ID as proof of residence, or if I had to bring in anything else. I’m pretty sure I had to bring mail? Anyway, after waiting around for a bit, they called me up, and the employee asked me a couple of questions, stamped some stuff, took my title, and informed me they’d mail me a new one. They also gave me my new license plates. I didn’t have to get a Massachusetts driver’s license; my out of state one was just fine. 

After getting the plates, I needed to pass an inspection within a week. I just gave a nearby trustworthy auto shop a call and asked for an inspection, and they told me to bring my car in that morning. They did their thing, gave me my sticker, and boom! All I had to do was wait around for a few days for my new title to come in the mail. 

Rereading your initial post, it looks like the main cause of confusion is that the car is under your family member’s name? I’m not sure how to accomplish switching it to yours first, but hopefully someone else has more info on that end. When I was confused about the insurance and transferring, I just called my (at that time) insurance agent and asked them to walk me through the steps of transferring the title. They usually know how that stuff works. 

TL;DR: find a Massachusetts insurance agent, get insurance, bring paperwork to RMV, pay an annoying amount of money for new plates, receive new title, and get inspection sticker.

1nn7hsz,EV MA License Plate Transfer?,boston,nfjagcy,NEU_Throwaway1,"https://www.mass.gov/how-to/transfer-your-registration-to-a-vehicle-or-trailer-purchased-from-an-individual

Yeah I think OP may have made a mistake letting the dealer register the new car for them without insisting they go through the transfer process. Dealerships do it for you as a courtesy so you can drive the car home immediately, but it sounds like the out of state dealership didn't know the MA procedure for transferring plates. 

This is the only circumstance when you can transfer the same plate from one car to the other - when it's the same class of car and you disposed of the old car. 

But to be fair it also sounds like if OP really was insistent on keeping their existing plate, they'd have to go through a pain in the ass in doing the transfer themselves.

They'd need to go to insurance first with their completed application and get their insurance to sign off and stamp it. 

If they financed the car, they'd have to go through the title application process and get the lienholder information as well, since the title will be in their hands until it's paid off. 

And there's a section that the dealer has to sign off on if it's a new vehicle too. 

OP says they want the EV plate to use for EV parking spots but I don't really think it's necessary if the car is quite obviously an electric or plug-in hybrid car... if it's a Tesla, Toyota Prius, or something else really obviously with EV in its title like the EV6, then I think you're gonna be fine...",1758509264.0,2025-09-21T22:47:44,4,t1_nfiru6z,False

It's an expensive city for sure, but I think it's really pleasant to live in over all- a lot of green space, better transit, walk ability, and bike infrastructure than most of the country, with museums and arts and universities all around. 

Job market and housing advice is going to be really dependent on what industry you're in, what your budget is, etc, so there isn't a lot people can see without more information. I can definitely say you should consider carefully whether having a car is important to you, because in a lot of neighborhoods having it will be a lot more of a hassle than a help, and it will be difficult to find parking, even if you're willing to pay. 

For keeping the kids entertained on a low budget and getting them exciting about a new home, I'm pretty sure the mayor has implemented a program where families can get cheap passes to go to the aquarium, zoo, museums, etc.

The general layout of public transit can be thought of as three separate things- buses, subway, and commuter rail

The commuter rail lines, purple on any mbta map you look at, extend out into the suburbs and mostly run frequently at peak commuting times. The subway is a little better for getting around downtown, but most efficient at getting you from the outer areas to the inner areas or vice versa. A little less good at getting you from one outer area to another. The buses can be really helpful or really annoying depending on where you are- they get stuck in traffic and can be a little less regular, but they cover gaps the subway doesn't. the app Transit can help you plot out what different routes would look like for you.",1758210926.0,2025-09-18T11:55:26,3,t3_1nkbfxu,False

As well as how long each step is expected to take and the schedule opitions. You can see the options a specific date and time as well.",1758220140.0,2025-09-18T14:29:00,2,t1_newubz7,True

> ### The Enhanced Driver’s License (EDL): A Special Case
> 
> A handful of states, primarily along the northern border, offer an Enhanced Driver’s License (EDL). These states are Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, and Washington. Ohio is also planning to offer them.
> 
> An EDL is a REAL ID-compliant card that has an additional feature: it contains a Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) chip. This chip allows the card to be used as a valid document for re-entry into the United States at land and sea border crossings from Canada, Mexico, and some countries in the Caribbean, serving as a limited alternative to a passport book or card for this specific purpose.
> 
> An EDL is not valid for international air travel.

1nimex8,Reared-ended by a car shown with insurance and then told insurance was canceled before accident,massachusetts,nes0r0x,0LDHATNEWBAT,"Operating without insurance and/or a revoked registration is not an arrestable offense in Massachusetts. Having an expired registration is just a civil motor vehicle infraction, it’s not criminal. If people can just use a phone to renew online, it’s very common for cops to allow them to do that instead of citing them and towing the car.

Operating with an expired/suspended license is arrestable but only if it happens in the officer’s presence. If they arrive at a crash and learn one of the drivers is unlicensed, no arrest can be made. Additionally, most courts dissuade officers from making arrests unless there’s additional factors involved like prior charges for the same offense. Courts consider expired/suspended licenses to be a very minor offense and the vast majority of the time the charge is dismissed. An arrest is considered to be a waste of the court’s time and a tad heavy handed for enforcement.

For situations where the registration is active but the operator is unlicensed, cops are obligated to inquire whether a licensed person can take control of the vehicle to avoid a tow. If someone can arrive in a timely manner, cops are supposed to let them.

How are you seeing all these reports that show officers handling these situations improperly? How many instances are you aware of? A cop is assuming a lot of liability if they allow an uninsured vehicle to drive off with revoked tags. I’m not claiming it doesn’t happen, but that cop could lose their job if the person doesn’t make it home safe. Even if another cop runs the plate and stops them… there’s going to be questions.",1758144268.0,2025-09-17T17:24:28,0,t1_nek5ft3,True

1nhijtc,Moving apartment - van parking bay suspension in Cambridge – £160-190+ for one day??,cambridge,nebrmyt,bartread,"Speaking personally, moving is incredibly stressful so this is not an area I'd be looking to cut costs: if your van has nowhere to park outside your property on the day of your move it's going to be a lot more stressful.

You also say ""van"" in the title and ""removal van"" in the content. So what is it? A transit style van? A Luton van? A large removal lorry?

Even a Luton van is going to need two or three cars worth of parking spaces to work comfortably, and I'd guess a lorry might need more like four or five cars worth (all depends how big the cars are, of course). The transit van, you could probably get away with two cars of parking spaces. In all cases you need plenty of room behind the van to load safety.

Do you really want to leave that to chance?

What I'd do is pay for the parking suspension on the day before and the day of to give people time to move their vehicles. If your removal van is turning up in the morning you need the spaces clear first thing, and you're much less likely to get that with an on the day only suspension, I suspect.

I'd think about buying some additional cones myself and then, as cars clear out, put them towards the outside edge of the parking bays to discourage others from parking. Obviously leave plenty of room for the remaining vehicles to get out.

Up to you, of course, but I'd say do everything you can to make the day of the move itself go as smoothly and easily as possible.",1757934757.0,2025-09-15T07:12:37,16,t3_1nhijtc,True

If there are double yellow lines nearby you can effectively park on them as long as there isn't a loading ban in place as well (kerb marks).

Here, every extra cone costs over £30—regardless of the actual manpower involved. That kind of pricing feels more like the council taking advantage than a genuine service, especially considering the already high taxes we pay.

And thats a reasonable position to hold. 

Not everyone can take a 1/2 day to find the council offices by bus and queue up for an appointment and another shorter trip to return things afterward. I'd wager most people would rather pay £200 for someone else to do all the legwork rather than take a day off work to do it, and the process you suggest doesn't help people who are moving to or from out of area.

WRT the price of cones, that is probably dictated by the number of cones they tend to lose.

As for high taxes, we get the services we pay for, if you want this service for free it means that some other service gets cut or everyone else gets to pay for your parking - there is no shareholder getting a payout.

1nl1x03,School board candidate claims to be a teacher...but isn't?,CambridgeMA,nf2juvv,diavolomaestro,"Let me lay out what I see as bad faith accusations:  
  
\- ""I didn't know she had a job"" is such a backhand way to imply that... what, you see her in your neighborhood during work hours, and she also handles school pickups? She clearly mentions she's a consultant right now, you can easily find her consulting website, and it's easy to conclude she probably works from home. (My wife is in the same exact position and she'd be pretty insulted if someone was like, ""Oh, I didn't know you had a job!"")

  
\- She doesn't ever imply that she was a public school teacher, just that she's worked with a number of public school systems. That's exactly what I'd write if I was a consultant who had literally had contracts with the school systems. It would actually be weird to say you were a teacher who'd worked \*with\* a school system rather than \*in\* or \*for\* it!

  
\- You're willing to call Lynn (and write this all up) but not willing to look her up on LinkedIn (only the biggest professional/career site in the world!) where she is easily findable and lists her prior school (The Waverly, in California)

  
\- You feel comfortable saying that ""Lynn"" has never heard of her based on one phone call. Whom exactly did you call? Again, my wife works in an adjacent industry (consulting with cities and nonprofits) and this type of strategic consulting is usually done at a higher level, often engaging with only a few people. So unless you called the Superintendent's Office and asked them to run a search for contractors paid by the school in the last 3 years, the odds are good that the person who picked up the phone doesn't know that name. Look, by no means are you obligated to run a deep search, but if you're going to do a negative post on a candidate based on a drive-by fact check, you're going to raise questions about your intentions.

And in case we get into a sockpuppet accusation battle, I've never met Caitlin Dube, and my reddit account is 12 years old. I'm a fellow Baldwin parent so I've heard her name a few times, which probably piqued my interest, but I don't know her.",1758289649.0,2025-09-19T09:47:29,10,t1_nf2a9t5,False

It's a sign to the lowly ticket-writers to avoid or else. 

  
One I was in line in the Somerville parking office when in storms this 30-something white guy.  He skips all 15 of us in line, literally shoulders a woman out of the way to start SCREAMING at the ticket counter employee. 

""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS TICKET?""

  
Turns out, he was a cop.  His personal vehicle was ticketed, but he had his ticket book on the dash, so he felt he should be immune to parking tickets.  ""I""M A COP!""

Kudos to the ticket counter person...she said, ""you can appeal the ticket, instructions are on the back.  If you want to speak more, get to the back of the line and wait your turn."" 

Guy was practically apoplectic with rage.  But it goes to show the entitlement of cops who feel they should be literally above the law.

But our council has basically abdicated any oversight of the city manager, ostensibly because it'll make it harder to attract quality candidates next time around but I suspect in practice because they have very little power and are themselves essentially beholden to the city manager if they want any of their priorities to happen. 

While the city manager has nothing to fear from the council, he has a lot to fear from the police - they are by far the biggest chunk of employees he oversees, and if they get restless they can do a lot of things that make his job more difficult. Which is probably why our current city manager has stated in a city council meeting that he won't support any police reforms not supported by the ""rank and file"", ie the police union. 

So while in theory the police are accountable to the manager and the manager is accountable to the council, in practice the council is beholden to the city manager and the city manager is beholden to the police.
