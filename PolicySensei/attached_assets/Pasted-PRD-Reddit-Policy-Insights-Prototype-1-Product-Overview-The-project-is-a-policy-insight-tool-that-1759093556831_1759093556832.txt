PRD: Reddit Policy Insights Prototype
1. Product Overview

The project is a policy insight tool that scrapes Reddit discussions relevant to Massachusetts state government agencies. It aggregates, summarizes, and presents these conversations in a concise, news-like format so agency leaders and their immediate staff can understand what citizens are praising or complaining about.

The product is not a policy suggestion engine—it strictly provides raw insights, curated into readable summaries, leaving judgment and prioritization to agency staff.

2. Problem Statement

Massachusetts agencies currently rely on direct grievances submitted via Mass.gov forms, which capture only a fraction of public sentiment. Citizens often vent or share positive experiences on social platforms like Reddit, but agencies lack visibility into these conversations.

Without this tool, policymakers:

Miss early signals of frustration (e.g., long lines, denied services).

Miss opportunities to highlight successes (e.g., streamlined processes).

Rely on fragmented or anecdotal inputs, slowing responsiveness.

3. Target Users

Primary: Mid-level staffers who report to agency heads (policy aides, deputies). They are responsible for surfacing issues and preparing briefs.

Secondary: Agency heads themselves, particularly when they want a snapshot for planning or communications.

Agencies in scope (initial pilot):

HHS (Health and Human Services)

RMV (Registry of Motor Vehicles)

General/other state functions

4. Objectives & Success Metrics
Objectives

Provide concise, relevant summaries of Reddit discussions for each agency.

Enable filtering by agency and time window (monthly).

Make insights shareable and subscribable, increasing their circulation in decision-making contexts.

Success Metrics (MVP)

Engagement: At least 50% of target users subscribe to monthly updates.

Relevance: >70% of surveyed users rate summaries as “relevant” or “very relevant.”

Actionability (qualitative): Users report using the insights in planning or communications.

5. Key Features (MVP)
5.1 Core Functionality

Reddit Scraping: Collect posts and comments related to Massachusetts agencies, focusing on the Boston/Massachusetts region.

Agency Filtering: Users select their agency (e.g., RMV, HHS, General).

Summarized Insights: Top 3 insights per agency per month, written as concise, newsletter-style blurbs (markdown text).

Sentiment Classification: Labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

5.2 User Experience

Dashboard/Feed: A clean, minimal interface resembling a “policy newsletter.”

Date Selector: Choose reporting period (default = most recent month).

Source Linking: Each insight links back to the original Reddit thread.

5.3 Distribution

Subscriptions: Users can subscribe for monthly updates via email.

Sharing: One-click share to copy or email a specific insight/report.

6. Non-Goals (for MVP)

No policy recommendations: The tool surfaces issues but does not propose actions.

No deep analytics or comparisons: No trendline comparisons across months in MVP.

No integrations with Mass.gov or internal systems (only email export for now).

7. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Sentiment Graphs: Visual breakdown of positive vs. negative sentiment over time.

Topic Categorization: Automatic grouping of issues (e.g., “licensing delays,” “health insurance coverage”).

Cross-agency Comparison: Ability to compare sentiment across agencies.

Automated Alerting: Real-time or weekly alerts for spikes in mentions.

8. Technical Considerations

Data Source: Reddit API + custom scrapers (Boston/Massachusetts-relevant subreddits and threads).

Processing: NLP models for sentiment analysis and summarization.

Frontend: Lightweight web app (React or similar) with simple authentication.

Output Format: Markdown text with optional tables for structured metrics (future).

9. User Workflow

User logs into the tool.

Selects agency (HHS, RMV, General).

Selects month (default = most recent).

Views a summary page with:

Top 3 insights (short, blog-like blurbs).

Labels (positive/negative).

Links to Reddit sources.

Optionally subscribes for future updates or shares a report via email.

10. Risks & Mitigations

Relevance risk: Reddit chatter may not map cleanly to agency mandates. → Mitigation: human curation for first prototypes.

Data consistency risk: Volume may vary drastically month to month. → Mitigation: always present “Top 3” regardless of volume.

Adoption risk: Busy staffers may not adopt. → Mitigation: email subscriptions and lightweight summaries (newsletter style).

11. Prototype KPI

The prototype’s KPI is perceived usefulness:

Do agency staff find the insights relevant and actionable?

Measured via short user feedback surveys after the first month of use.
