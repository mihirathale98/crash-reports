I recently moved to Boston for work and I truly love the city, but I’ve been running into some serious challenges when it comes to accessing healthcare.

I work about 14 miles outside the city and leave home before 8 in the morning, not returning until after 6 in the evening. By the time I get back, nearly every clinic is closed. This has made it very difficult to get the care I need. Right now I’m actively searching for both a psychiatrist and an endocrinologist, but I have not been able to find anyone who offers weekend hours or later evening appointments that would fit my schedule.

I do have insurance through UHC, but the options I’ve found so far are extremely limited. The one endocrinologist I managed to get find an appointment with was booked two months out, and the out-of-pocket costs were very high. I can’t wait that long, and I really need to find something more accessible as soon as possible.

If anyone knows of providers in Boston who are trans-friendly, open on weekends, or available for later appointments, please share. I would be so grateful for any help or recommendations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1nrk8o1/health_resources_for_trans_women_open_on_weekends/,Aromatic_Net6137,1758941390.0,2025-09-26T22:49:50,22,0

I contacted the Department of Inspectional Services, they told me that it’s a state issue since all bees are protected, then she gave me the number for The Department of Public Health, they have an automated service I press 0 to speak to an operator and then it doesn’t ring and it says ext- 2005501 is not available and to leave a message.

A member of my family sadly passed away a few months ago at a relatively young age.  They left behind a very nice one bedroom apartment (Roslindale) filled with high quality furniture, appliances (like a Miele vacuum cleaner), and effects (artwork, lamps, etc).  My relative had really good, somewhat expensive taste, this is not cheap stuff. None of it is antique, but it’s all quality and they were meticulous about keeping their home clean. It’s all like new. 

The will is currently going through probate but the sole heir does not want most of this stuff, nor any proceeds from selling them. 

We would ideally like to find a non-profit that would accept and pick up some or all of this stuff. And of course there are the usual suspects, but to honor the memory of my relative we’d love to find a charity or non-profit able to handle this donation that served mental health for poor folks, children (especially girls or young mothers), recently released prisoners, or the unhoused specifically, in about that order of preference.  For example, Habitat for Humanity would be ok if we can’t get closer to something specific to the categories enumerated above. Smaller and more local to Boston is better.  My relative (like me!) was raised in Boston and lived here all their life, and loved this city passionately. So we’d like the benefit to stay here. 

We realize we could have an estate broker handle the whole thing and just give the cash proceeds as a donation, but those proceeds  are likely to be much less  than this stuff may be a worth. Conservatively I’d guess there’s five thousand bucks worth of furniture (at used resale value) alone.  And it’s all in showroom condition. 

Any suggestions would be most welcome, thank you. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1nn0hxo/where_to_donate_high_quality_furniture_appliances/,MonsieurReynard,1758481352.0,2025-09-21T15:02:32,28,70

Well, there's one company that I kept seeing, posting on pretty much all the job search sites, with the postings clearly constantly being refreshed because they always showed up as being posted in the last few days.

I was getting bad, predatory vibes and Googled the company - I didn't see the best reviews from former employees and there were definitely some concerns, but last week, I decided what the heck, I can see for myself how it is, and at the very least maybe I’ll get to practice my interviewing skills, so I applied.

I got an ""interview"" that was basically telling me about the company and the job, then asking me like 2 surface level questions that gave them no sense of me as a person or employee.

Then, I was offered a job.

The pay is bad and non negotiable. Like, what I'd made with a few years less experience \*and\* before I got licensures/certifications that are associated with a like 50% pay bump. Sure, I could \*survive\* off the pay, but I couldn't save for retirement or even really build back the emergency fund I've dipped into, etc.

\*And\* I would be trapped with being unable to supplement the low pay because the contract says I'd have to get the company's permission to do any other work. Doesn't matter if it were outside work hours and in no way competing with or a conflict of interest with my work for them (think not even be able to give a training, etc.).

There are also no professional upsides/perks - no opportunities to collaborate with colleagues, to network, or in any way grow professionally or strengthen my resume. Plus, even if I'm proactive about trying to engage with coworkers, given the ""interview"" and the bad pay, I worry that the company attracts a decent amount of employees who are naive, desperate, and/or just really don't care about their work and doing their job well.

The final concern is that a lot of the backend onboarding stuff takes time, so I wouldn't even be able to start for like 8 weeks. I'd just be sitting around dreading my start date.

Genuinely, the only reason I'd take the job is because I'm assuming that I'll lose unemployment if I turn it down.

If I'm being honest, I feel like I'm headed toward a psych hospitalization at this point - either from the stress of losing unemployment or from signing on with a company that clearly just wants to use me and exploit me in a way that triggers an extensive trauma history. Like, I feel like I'm being forced to take a job that I might not even be able to do because of how badly my mental health might tank. And I've never felt that way about a job before; I've never had a job trigger my trauma history. And I really can't afford an inpatient stay right now.

But, I have to accept or else forfeit unemployment, right?",https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1nqrgcs/tldr_refusing_suitable_work_i_have_to_accept_even/,meerkatmensch,1758859037.0,2025-09-25T23:57:17,35,95

We are so grateful to Kat for sharing her family's story and honoring Brady's memory through her work.

The news story coincided with the release of our [poll](https://www.mafamiliesforvaccines.org/polling25) showing that 70% of Massachusetts voters support eliminating the religious exemption from required school vaccines by passing H.2554/S.1557. This is the fourth legislative session in which our bills have been introduced, and the issue is more urgent than ever (especially with other states like Florida moving in the opposite direction), so we are trying to make sure that legislators understand that these bills really are popular! We are grateful to Governor Healey and the Massachusetts DPH for their recent leadership on COVID vaccine access, and hope that the legislature will take this next step to improve herd immunity across Massachusetts.

H.2554 has advanced out of the Public Health Committee, but S.1557 is still waiting for a vote there, so one of our priorities right now is reaching out to senators on the Committee. You can email five of them at once [here](https://www.mafamiliesforvaccines.org/publichealthcommittee). You can also sign up for our email list to get updates [here](https://www.mafamiliesforvaccines.org/updates).

One day we were the last two people in the office, waiting for the clock to tick down to 5PM. I didn’t know her well even though we sat near the same set of cubes. She was quiet and introverted and I mostly left her alone. We didn’t work together on the same projects.

On this day, I said hi to her, asked her how she was doing and asked what town she was from in Massachusetts or New England, assuming she was from here. She spoke with no accent so hence the assumption. 

To my surprise, she said she actually grew up in poverty near Monroe, Louisiana. She spent the first few years of her life in a house with no indoor plumbing. Her family later “upgraded” to a former FEMA trailer that was used to house people in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 

As a teenager and young adult, she worked at various fast food joints for close to federal minimum wage. Most of her coworkers at these places were frequently on drugs or weren’t really reliable or well-put together. Before she moved to Massachusetts, she worked as an assistant manager at a Popeyes making like $11 an hour in 2022. 

In fact, she mentioned how much substance abuse there was in the community where she grew up. 

She also mentioned how Northern Louisiana is kind of sketchy and dangerous. She laughed at the suggestion that there’s any place in Massachusetts that’s “rough”. She was frequently cat-called and mentioned how she was in fear for her life a few times while living in Northern Louisiana. She has not been cat-called at all in Massachusetts in the three years she’s been here.

She went to college part-time online and applied for all sorts of jobs outside the South, hoping to get out. Eventually she did, bringing her boyfriend with her. They now live just outside Boston. 

I remarked that Massachusetts is an expensive state and that lots of natives move down South because of the cheaper cost of living and nicer weather. She was aghast. “Nicer weather? It’s sticky most of the time!” Cheaper cost of living? “It was on the backs of people making federal minimum wage!”

She mentioned wanting to move closer to work and I replied that New Hampshire is a cheaper place to live closer to where our office was. 

She told me she would never move to a place like NH after having grown up in the South. She said she didn’t want to move to a place with “few government services” or “people who didn’t value them”.

We do live in a 1930s terrace which doesn't have the best sound insulation, but equally we've had students who aren't a bother which suggests it's a people problem rather than just insulation.

After a couple of years of considerate tenants we're back to constant screaming and slamming (and I mean wall shaking) from 11-3am every night. Also mild annoyances like using our dropped kerb as their personal parking spot.

We've had a quote for full back to bricks sound insulation and decoration which is £20k+ just for downstairs, which won't resolve upstairs, which would presumably be another 20k. We've decided we need to move which is shit but we can't control them we can only control what we do next.

We had planned to move last year but had to care for a terminally ill family member, and I also have some ongoing medical issues. I also have PTSD I'm being treated for so the loud noises waking me up are a treat. 

Aside from speaking with them, we've tried all the usual, estate agent, council, councillor, university (ARU) The neighbours themselves literally said we should be 'kinder' as they're students. Not sure what to do with that information. They then proceeded to stand out in the street two nights later drunkenly screaming that we should go and fuck ourselves. That's not very kind, haha.

Anyways, am I missing something? I thought our MP, but what could they do? Doesn't seem extreme enough for police. I just need to get through the next six months while we put the house on the market and move. Currently it's like sleep roulette and my mental health is deteriorating 😭

* Create a Combined Sewer Overflow Commission.
* Provide a cost-benefit analysis of a 25-year level of CSO control.
* Improve stormwater regulations.
* Include green stormwater infrastructure.
* Improve public outreach regarding sewer infrastructure planning.

# Why is this important?

The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority has **not** taken seriously feedback from watershed advocates. Despite enormous public outcry, the MWRA refuses to include feedback from the public in their sewage pollution plans. The amount of sewage that is dumped into Alewife Brook is illegal and MWRA knows it. But MWRA wants to continue using Alewife Brook as an open sewer, despite having the financial ability to fix the problem. 

The collaborative planning process between Cambridge, Somerville, and MWRA is ongoing. This local legislation is separate from that effort. It creates another avenue for Cambridge to create it’s own a path towards community health by ending sewage pollution.

# What’s next?

**1.** MWRA, Cambridge, & Somerville will host their big public Sewage Pollution Planning Meeting on 9/25. This is the last public meeting that they will hold before submitting their sewage pollution plans to EPA and MassDEP.

**2.** We expect Cambridge City Council to deliberate on the newly proposed legislation. The vote from the Health & Environment Committee will happen as early as September 29th.

# The Presentations.

You can watch the video of the Committee’s hearing [**here**](https://cambridgema.granicus.com/player/clip/1069?view_id=1&redirect=true) on Combined Sewer Overflows from September 9th, 2025. 

The Committee listened to a presentation from **City Engineer Jim Wilcox**. **Emily Norton** and **Julie Wood** from the Charles River Watershed Association had an awesome presentation. **Patrick Herron** from Mystic River Watershed Association was amazing! **Kristin Anderson** & **Eppa Rixey** from Save the Alewife Brook presented last.

**City Engineer Jim Wilcox** said, “The crown jewel of the CAM 004 \[CSO sewer separation project from twenty years ago\]  was the construction of the Alewife Wetland. This wetland was constructed in the Alewife Reservation as part of sewer separation work. We need to demonstrate that we’re not increasing flooding… the Alewife Wetland serves two purposes. One is it provides what’s called stormwater detention, which is control of flows \[meaning reduction of flooding\]… It also provides treatment of stormwater through the plants and soils. This is a four acre installation,… a $12 million component of the CAM 004 \[Huron and Concord Ave area \] sewer separation project.”

**Emily Norton**, Executive Director of Charles River Watershed Association stated, “It is **not legal** to dump sewage in our rivers.”

**Patrick Herron**, Executive Director of the Mystic River Watershed Association said, “Imagine if you have just used the toilet and you live in a combined sewer area in Cambridge, you flush the toilet and whatever happened in that toilet arrives at Alewife Brook in the condition that it left. It’s not treated…. There are real consequences to this… **We would support one of two outcomes: complete sewer separation OR a 25-year level of control.**”

**Eppa Rixey**, Steering Committee Member from Save the Alewife Brook said, “We don’t see Cambridge committing to sewer separation in the Long Term Sewage Control Planning process.” Cambridge needs to include sewer separation in the Long Term Sewage Control Plan.

# The Roundtable Discussion

https://preview.redd.it/5o35ip9jhzpf1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99eb16c2cee8a9e73093c84719ee21f6c9fb7791

**Chair of Health & Environment Committee Councillor Patty Nolan** said,  
“**It’s a public health threat**, in addition to a calamity and an economic disaster when that flooding occurs… It’s an existential threat that affects our lives across so many different domains. We need to keep that in mind as we think about ways to do this… **How can we not address this when this is something critical to our future and livability as a city?** **We’re Cambridge. We can solve this.** And if we can’t, then who can? We look forward to hopefully having the Coalition work together with both the Council and the City Staff as we move forward, understanding this will supplement the work that’s being done.”

# Slowness of the Project Progress

With the Long Term Sewage Planning process now in its fourth year, Councillors at the meeting expressed concerns. They believe the City needs to move faster to end sewage pollution.

# Cost Concerns were raised

[Vice Mayor McGovern](https://preview.redd.it/id5ubpxmhzpf1.jpg?width=676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4589bd3f1697fcf1d84a1d7ab50e0e3582ce5284)

**Vice Mayor McGovern** said, “What are we doing at the State level to push our State Representatives and State Senators to figure out what they can do, to figure out how to get more money?”



[Councillor Cathie Zusy](https://preview.redd.it/791ym9aphzpf1.jpg?width=622&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d8edabd8713a244302bff0cb7fdcc32fcfc2c10)

**Councillor Cathie Zusy** asked, “Will we \[Cambridge\] be paying the $30 million \[for the CSO tank at Bellis Circle / Sherman Street\] or will MWRA be paying for it?”

Cambridge’s **City Engineer Jim Wilcox** replied, “that is part of the cost-sharing discussion with MWRA.”

**Charles River Watershed Association’s Executive Director Emily Norton said,** “I respect that MWRA tries to keep rates low. But how much do we value clean water? How much do we value not having toilet paper and tampon applicators going into our basements? How much do we value being able to swim in the Charles River? Our [**Cut the Crap**](https://www.crwa.org/cutthecrap) campaign is also directed at MWRA. People want to see this. Let’s have a conversation about how we pay for it. There are creative ways to raise funds.”

**Councillor Patty Nolan said,** “Cambridge has been spending $30 to $50 million ***each year*** on sewer infrastructure and stormwater control.”

# Neighborhood construction concerns came up.

https://preview.redd.it/ko5v5v9shzpf1.jpg?width=230&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a09c398907366ecb1faacaab020c20ab581c7184

**Councillor Azeem** said, “The neighbors feel that \[sewage pollution\] is a negative impact already. So maybe the neighborhood would be willing to put up with disruption in the short run, if it meant that \[sewage pollution\] would become less of a problem in the future.”

  
**Cambridge City Engineer Jim Wilcox said,** “When we do these sewer separation projects, it’s not just doing the sewer separation work. We also have to look at the condition of the other utilities that are in the street, particularly water utilities, gas utilities. So it’s not just sewer separation work, it’s also other work that needs to be done at the same time.”

**Councillor Wilson said, “**That health conditions have developed from not handling this sooner is a concern to me… In terms of timeline, where is the level of urgency when working with our capital partners \[MWRA & Somerville\]?”

**Vice Mayor McGovern** said, “I know the concerns around doing too much construction and too much upheaval in neighborhoods. And I know construction is never a pleasant thing. But it’s necessary. And I’m glad that we’re a city that is continuing to invest in infrastructure improvements. I, too, want to be on record saying, how can we move more quickly?”

I went to this so you didn't have to! Actually I went to do some research for my show and it was steps from my apartment. Speaking of my show, did I mention we've interviewed all of the challengers (except for Robert Winters (LibsofTikTok fan) and Tim Flaherty (he had to cancel interview due to court obligation and wasn't interested in rescheduling) here?: [What's That About? Special 2025 Challenger Candidate for City Council Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL395FYpKfPtnFQU19IENUFnKuO4VWDRG8)

Here are my notes:

**Most Importantly** Mayor Denise Simmons couldn't attend because ICE kidnapped some poor Cambridge soul off the street. She stopped in to announce this had happened and that they were working to help the family involved, but wouldn't have any more details till later. 

On to the non-fascist stuff:

There were two separate forums, adding up to 14 candidates. Each candidate was given 90 seconds to introduce themselves. After the intros, each candidate was asked questions for 4 minutes in turn by Jesse Kanson-Benanav, Executive Director of Abundant Housing MA (CORRECTED), based on the candidate's answers to the ABC [questionnaire](https://www.abettercambridge.org/25quest). The candidates did not interact much with each other's answers. Below are my brief impressions of what they said based on my notes. I'm trying to stay as accurate to the meat of what they actually said, minimizing editorializing.

Group one: Patty Nolan, Ned Melanson, Ayah Al-Zubi, Zion Sherin, Peter Hsu, Ayesha Wilson, Marc McGovern

**Patty N**: Says: she is data-driven ""for better or worse"". Not afraid to take unpopular positions if the data tells her to. She says  she wants 5 foot ""step-backs"" for higher stories of tall buildings along Mass Ave corridor, not ""set-backs"" which was what she wrote? Seems to be for rent stabilization. Says she wants to streamline ""onerous"" regulations. 

**Ned M**: Says: Housing is the most pressing issue of our time. It is morally important to build more density in transit oriented Cambridge. ""Suburban experiment has failed"" Environmentally the right thing to do. Blue states need more housing. Says he supports Social Housing.

**Ayah A-Z**: Says she is a renter who has been forced to move 5x in 7 years, forced her to organize her fellow renters for tenant protections, if elected vows to push city for much stronger tenant protections. Strong advocate for ""deeply affordable housing"" and social housing. Wants to center communities of color. Took city to task for shutting down transitional wellness center shelter. Aims to re-open a non-congregate shelter if elected.

**Zion S**: Spoke for co-ops and more dorm-like housing for young people. Wants to leverage bond rating to build affordable housing. Wants to go back to previous setbacks in neighborhood and spoke a lot about not changing neighborhoods in push to build more housing. Wants to keep yards, says ""green roofs can't support bunnies"".  Doesn't seem to want to knock down any building more than 50 years old. Says knocking down buildings is very disruptive and ruins neighborhoods, he knows because he's been on construction work sites, unlike his co-candidates(he implied) 

**Peter H**. Says he's the only one running on a public health platform. Says housing is a public health issue. Wants to prioritize housing for certain occupations. When asked, he said exact occupations would be picked by ""community discussion"". Wants to build tall on corridors and squares. 

**Ayesha W**: Wants to protect rights of people already here. Not ready to commit on CSQ rezoning, thinks we need more community input. Says because the community is not sure, she is not sure. Will only be ready when community is ready. Also backs social housing.

**Marc M**: Says ""I'm lucky, I've always had a place to live."" Even when his family struggled growing up. His great-grand parents bought their place in the 1920's. If not for them he  wouldn't be able to live here. ""Being housed shouldn't rely on luck"" Wants to build more affordable housing on public lands. Made the point that density not only good for the environment, but for the culture and small business. Also (my impression) subtly referenced Ayesha Wilson's comment by saying sometimes you need to make a controversial decision, it's the job.

\------

Group Two: Stan Rivkin, Burhan Azeem, Sumbul Siddiqui, Dana Bullister, Louise Venden, Jivan Sobrinho Wheeler, Catherine Zusy (arrived later)

**Stan R**: Says: Cambridge is one of the most unequal cities in the country by income. We've relied too much on private developments. Strongly against decreasing 20% affordable housing requirement. Speaks strongly for ""deeply affordable housing"" and social housing. Points out most current affordable housing requirements completely leave out anyone making below 56k per year. Speaks for the need to raise taxes if necessary to achieve social housing goals, points out Cambridge has the lowest residential tax rates in the state.

**Burhan A**: When questioned on why he thought the proposed 8 stories on Cambridge St. corridor is too high, he mentions that those sizes don't pencil out and will falsely raise expectations. Thinks 6 stories is better. Points out the ""missing-middle"" that he tried to push through city-wide was partially criticized because it wouldn't produce enough housing. Wants to implement tax abatements to encourage more affordable housing construction. Thinks historical commissions influence should be reduced, currently they're being used as a NIMBY veto (my words) for good projects.

**Sumbul S**: Grew up in Cambridge Affordable housing. Wants to increase heights especially in squares and corridors. Wants to push infill housing, good for community and the environment.

**Dana B**: Says she loves Cambridge a lot. Wants more housing choices for people including smaller units and SROs if there's demand. Thinks its important to build more housing in Cambridge because it gives people option of being car-less. Status quo forces people to be drivers who don't want to be. Wants tenants to have more power to negotiate, and thinks best way to do that is to add more units. Wants to legalize mid-rise single stair housing, remove other unnecessary regs.

**Louise V**: Says Government needs to be accountable and city hasn't done enough research before implementing new housing regs. Wants to do more studies to figure out where to build housing. Says last study in 2019 (Envision Cambridge) is too long ago. Apparently doesn't think CSQ needs 18 stories, public doesn't want it. She used to be elected official in Provincetown, they had a housing trust and public-private housing partnerships. Wants to do more of those in Cambridge. Doesn't want to disrupt historic neighborhoods.

**Jivan S-W**: Backed new multi-family zoning, says less stringent setback requirements were necessary to change incentives. Status quo had meant triple deckers were vulnerable to being tore down and replaced with millionaire single family homes because setbacks were required (almost all existing triple-deckers would not be legal under old exclusionary zoning). Wants to increase linkage fees to fund more social housing.

**Catherine Z**: Voted against multi-family zoning because she says it will hurt neighborhoods. Won't support 2030 goal of 12,500 more housing units in Envision study. Walks back criticism of ABC as ""paid special interest group"". (I didn't catch exactly what she said, but she said she was cranky and didn't mean it)",https://www.reddit.com/r/CambridgeMA/comments/1nec6tj/report_from_abc_city_council_candidate_forum_at/,wombatofevil,1757605360.0,2025-09-11T11:42:40,47,28
