The short story is that I work almost exclusively with clients transferring to the Boston area, and now that it's optional for renters to pay a broker fee, most clients aren't interested in doing so. (Shocker, I know.)

Initially, I thought I'd be out of the business entirely by now, but I've had a couple of new clients unexpectedly pop up. (For the time being, some employers are still covering the broker fee for relocations.)  So twice now I've had that moment of: ""wow, I've just toured my last property"" only to later find out later I wasn't quite finished. Potentially, I showed my last property on Tuesday. We shall see.

In the meantime, it would be a shame not to share a few stories before I go. Because…the public has a right know.

**SELECT STORIES**

 **Free food**

 A couple years ago, my clients and I are waiting in the lobby at an apartment building in Quincy for a listing agent who is running 30 minutes late. As I'm having a conversation with my clients, a middle-aged man comes into the building, sees a free box of dog treats and says ""hey look, free food"" as he grabs the box and takes it away. Several minutes later, he comes back downstairs and puts the box back on the table, complaining that the cookies were too hard to chew. The look on my clients' faces suggested that they were probably not going to rent in this buildling.

 **Unwanted Visitor**

I've found out the hard way that even if a unit is supposed to be empty, it's safer to knock first. On multiple occasions, I've entered units that were supposedly empty only to find people inside. Once, my clients and I ended up entering the wrong unit by mistake because the property manager listed a unit on the tour sheet that we were NOT supposed to visit. Since we were given a master key, the door unlocked anyway and we came face to face with some very surprised tenants.

 One of the more bizarre encounters of walking in on clients was when I went to show a 4 bed - 2 bath unit in Brookline. I knew the unit was still tenanted, but I didn't know if anybody would be home. The listing agent didn't show up; it was just me with my clients joining virtually via a video call.

 As soon as I entered, I was met by a college-aged male who complained to me that the agent never notified him about the tour (I had given the listing agent 48 hours to notify the tenants) and it was too early on a Sunday morning to be touring the unit (it was 11am on a Monday morning). He then demanded that I take my shoes off, told me I could not make any noise, and that I couldn't tour the living room because he and a ""guest"" were sleeping in there. (The living room had been converted into a makeshift bedroom which was closed off by a curtain over the doorway.)

 While this young man was giving me instructions, a 3rd occupant comes downstairs and leaves. Now I'm starting to wonder just how many more people I am going to encounter.

 I begin the tour starting with the kitchen, at which time a college-aged female comes down from the upstairs bathroom - wearing pajamas - and enters a bedroom where she and her boyfriend were apparently still sleeping. In an upstairs bedroom, I find another occupant in her pajamas. All told, I found evidence of at least 7 people living in that small unit, although there could have been one or two more. (I'll never no for sure.)

**Justice is Served**

 One of the biggest headaches that renters face is landlords who try to unfairly deduct money from the security deposit. In one particular case, my clients had caused minor damage upon moveout (which the clients were willing to pay for) but the property manager wanted to take out extra money for issues that the clients were clearly not responsible for. Since my clients had already moved back to Europe, taking the landlord to small claims court to fight these charges was not an option. And as long as I didn't agree for the extra charges to be taken out of the deposit, the property manager refused to hand over any amount (which was around $5000-60000).

 Most renters - and many landlords - are not aware that MA has very strict requirements regarding the security deposit and how it is handled. Using this to my advantage, I emailed the property manager on day 29 after move-out, explaining that he had 1 day to return the security deposit before the landlord would be hit with a penalty worth three times the security deposit amount. The entire security deposit was returned the next day.

 **The Time Waster**

 Many of my clients were a pleasure to work with, but of course there were some exceptions. One of those clients was a lady whose search criteria changed drastically from day to day. Initially we were looking mainly at apartment complexes. Then the budget was cut and we were looking exclusively at private options in an entirely different area. Then the budget changed again and we started looking everywhere. This went on for about 3 weeks.

 In the meantime, I started becoming curious about what my client did for a living. At some point, she remarked that her job was related to death (in an obvious effort to gain some ""sympathy points."") It later turns out that she worked in the legal department of a pharmaceutical company, and her job was to clear her company of wrongdoing each time a patient died during experimental treatments. (Poor lady.)

 I don't know if it was a coincidence, but I spent more time with this client than almost any other individual I had ever worked with. And instead of renting a place, she ended up not transferring to Boston all (which means I made exactly $0 from this client).

 **Listing Agent with Attitude**

 Once I was touring units with a couple who had a budget of around $7000-8000, so we were looking for something nice and modern. One of the places we visited was a large two family (located around the Watertown/Newton area). The listing agent was with us this time, but we probably would have been better off without him.

Upon entering the unit, a middle-aged woman came running down the stairs believing that we were intruders. The listing agent very rudely explained that we were here to tour the unit, and then proceeded to ignore the lady for the rest of the tour.

Pro tip for listing agents: don't piss off the tenants. The house was a disaster, and I'm not sure if it wasn't on purpose. On the second floor banister, women's panties and bras were hanging to dry, and there also clothes that looked like they had been randomly thrown everywhere. When we tried to tour one of the bedrooms, a 20-something male opened the door and refused to let us in. I got the impression that there was something in that room that the young man did not want us to see.

 Once we were outside (and feeling a little safer), the listing agent explained that these tenants never responded to messages and he was tired of dealing with them. Which is fair I guess. But yeah, that was awkward.

**CONFESSIONS**

 OK, I get it: you didn't click on the title of this post for some cheesy stories; you came here for the good stuff. So, let's talk about the ""dark side"" of the real estate business.

 Obviously, not all real estate agents are ""scum"" (depending on who you talk to) but from my personal experiences I cannot claim in good faith that unethical behavior among agents is the exception (as opposed to the rule). Let's start with an easy example.

 **Phishing for Clients**

 There are two main variants of this scheme, and both are very common. The first is to post ""too-good-to-be-true"" fake listings on websites in order to pick up clients. One of the most annoying aspects of my job was getting sent a bunch of listings from apartments.coms and having to sort through which are real vs. fake in order to schedule tours for units that actually existed. (**edit:** typically over half of the requested listings were fake.)

A second way agents phish for clients is to copy a real listing and repost it with their own contact information. Using this method, an unscrupulous agent attempts to steal potential clients away from the listing agent. With the current broker fee rules, this would potentially make a tenant believe they are working with the listing agent (which would incur no broker fee) when in fact they are working with an agent who will try to squeeze a broker fee out of the tenants.

**Artificial Intelligence photos**

The use of AI to enhance real estate photos has gotten out of hand. To be clear, I have no issue with using AI technology for marketing purposes in order to make photos look better. But when a client cannot recognize an apartment from the photos in the listing, there is a problem. I recently saw a listing which had two AI generated photos of the same room, with one version of the room having 3 windows while the other version of the room had only 2.

**Forcing the Tenant to Pay both Agents**

Although a tenant no longer pays the listing agent - thanks to a new law that took effect in August - this practice went on for decades and many people don't realize had unethical it actually was. To explain the scheme, it's important to understand the background. First of all, once generic real estate sites (such as Zillow) started popping up, tenants no longer needed agents to find properties, which meant landlords no longer needed agents to find tenants. But rather than accept this new reality, agents in certain locations such as Boston devised a scheme that would force tenants to pay broker fees whether they wanted to or not.

 In short, the listing agent charged the tenant a 1-month broker fee which had to be paid before the fully-executed lease would be handed over to the tenant. If the tenant had an agent, the listing agent would then split this fee with that agent. And if the tenant did not have an agent, the listing agent would keep the entire 1-month broker fee. As a result of this scheme, both the listing agent and tenant's agent were guaranteed to get paid. The two biggest issues with this scheme were that (1) the tenant was forced to pay for a service whether they wanted to or not and (2) the tenant was forced to pay for an agent who represented the interests of the landlord (which were in opposition to the interests of the tenant).

 **No Co-Broke Listings**

Thankfully, no-co-broke listings are also mostly a thing of the (recent) past, but they are still worth mentioning here because they are a reflection of bad things have become. For those who don't know, a no co-broke listing is a listing in which the listing agent declares upfront that they will not share the broker fee with the tenant's agent.

 If I had a client who requested to visit a no co-broke property, the listing agent refused to show the property if I (as an agent) was the one who requested the tour. Not only was this unfair to these tenants, it was also unfair to the landlord because they were potentially missing out on some very good tenants. In other words, the listing agents clearly put their own interests above the interests of the landlords by listing these properties as no co-brokes. (Note: some of these listing agents were also the owners, but since owners in general are not allowed to collect broker fees from tenants, this doesn't justify anything.)

 **The Last Month's Rent Scam**

Agents aren't the only people who behave badly. Every time tenants complain that charging both last month's rent AND a security deposit is excessive, landlords will immediately push back (as loudly as possible) with claims that it's necessary to do so for their own protection. And I get that…when you're dealing with tenants with bad credit who are renting out low-end apartments. But landlords don't stop there: they also (as a rule) require last month rent's from all clients, even if they are VIP clients with stellar credit.

One main benefit of doing this is that it amounts to an interest-free loan for the landlord. In the meantime, the landlord is depriving the tenant of utilizing the money, which rightfully still belongs to the tenant. Another possible reason for grabbing last month's rent is that some of these landlords are attempting to steal this rent payment altogether. Consider the fact that many of the wealthier clients have housing allowances, and others have their rent paid for them directly via the company. This makes these clients prime targets for double paying last month's rent at the end of the year because they have forgotten that the last month has already been paid for.

**Security Deposit Theft**

Most people are aware that some landlords try to deduct bogus charges from a security deposit simply because they can get away with it. But it's also not uncommon for landlords to steal the security deposit altogether. I remember one tenant (not my client) who never got their deposit (of $8000) back because the landlord ghosted the client. This type of theft is easy to pull off if the landlord lives overseas and doesn't put the money in a local bank (as required by state law).

**Lead paint disclosure fiasco**

The lead paint disclosure is a disaster, and the main blame falls on the state legislature for coming up with this nonsense. First of all, by requiring a lead paint disclosure, most landlords refuse to test their houses for lead paint because doing so is a liability. They would rather allow their tenants to live in houses where the likely presence of lead paint is unconfirmed rather than deal with the dread of admitting to prospective tenants that their property has tested positive for lead paint.

 The biggest problem with the current laws is that they have resulted in blatant discrimination against families with small children. The current law states that if a family with children 6 or under moves into a property, the landlord must test that property. If the property has lead paint, the owner is obligated to spend thousands of dollars to de-lead the property before move-in (regardless of whether the landlord can afford it.)

 If MA was serious about protecting children, it would financially help landlords to remove lead paint. Instead, the financial obligation is placed on the landlords, which has most often led to the following situations:

1. The landlord simply ignores the requirement to test a house when small children move in.
2. The landlord does not accept a tenant's application based on the fact that they have small children.

That said, there is that (rare) occurrence when the landlord does de-lead the home before the tenants move in. As a result, the tenants are forced to find (and pay for) temporary housing during the de-leading process, which is also a huge inconvenience.

 The main reason for mentioning lead paint in this confession list is because listing agents play a major role in enabling the landlords to discriminate against families with small children, and it is a regular occurrence.

 **Award for Worst Behavior**

Of all the agents I've worked with over the years, one in particular stands out. Unethical actions included:

1. Aggressively claiming during price negotiations that the landlord would never accept such a price, only to discover that the agent was the landlord (which should have been disclosed). At that point, I found it a little awkward having to listen to her talk about herself in 3rd person. (No, I never mentioned to her that I knew: I don't ""show my cards"" unless it is in my client's best interests to do so.)
2. Stealth-editing the listing for the unit after my client's application had been approved to increase the amount that the client was required to pay upfront. (The initially required payments were clearly stated on the approved application.)
3. Instructing my client to pay her (i.e. the listing agent's) broker fee directly into her personal bank account so her broker wouldn't take a commission.

So yeah, well done my friend. You deserve a round of applause.

 **BROKER FEE ""BAN"" FOLLOWUP**

There was a lot of discussion about the potential consequences of changing the broker fee law, and we are starting to see the actual results now.  Here are some of the consequences I've already noticed:

**Resorting to Bribery**

Many people predicted that landlords would raise rent prices to cover the fees. So far, I haven't seen clear evidence of this occurring. On the contrary, due to weaker-than usual demand, prices this year are either holding steady or even dropping a bit. But that hasn't stopped agents with finding ways to ""outsmart"" the new law. For example, I had a client who applied for a unit at the listed price. The listing agent counter-offered with a higher rent price to cover her broker fee. In other words: the listing agent told my clients that if they wanted to be accepted, they had to pay her broker fee.

**The Moment of Truth for Landlords has Arrived**

 Anecdotal evidence suggests that some landlords who've worked with agents in the past are now choosing to find tenants themselves rather than pay a listing agent. Although this not a surprise, it does confirm that these landlords - who had no problem with forcing their tenants to pay broker fees - are unwilling to pay the fees themselves.

 **Listing Agents are Scrambling**

The sudden change in the law has left some listing agents scrambling to figure out how to get paid. Since August 1st, multiple listing agents have asked me directly if the relocation company was paying my fee. (No, they do not.)  I'm not sure why they were asking, but the implication is that they wanted to charge my clients if my fee was already covered by a 3rd party.

 Another thing agents appear to be doing is pretending to NOT be the listing agent, which is something agents can potentially get away with by posting listings on sites like Zillow. (That's actually genius guys, good luck.)

Additionally, it would be remiss of me not to point out that there are real estate agencies in the Boston area who have built their entire business model on offering exclusive no co-broke listings. (OK, maybe there is just one, and everybody who knows the rental market knows exactly who I'm talking about.) To skirt around the law, their website calls their broker fee a ""rental fee."" In my opinion, this makes a mockery out of the new law, but then again…what are these agents supposed to do?

 **The People Have Had Enough**

The demand for agents appears to have plummeted overnight. Even my clients who get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year don't want to pay for an agent if given the choice. And while none of this is surprising, people in general are not yet willing to recognize that agents do provide a valuable (even if overpriced) service.

For example, the clients that requested we tour 30 properties would never consider scheduling so many options on their own. And those clients who rode in my car as we toured properties in Boston will opt to take public transportation while touring ""solo."" People will miss good rental opportunities because they are not familiar with the market. House finding will take longer, and be more confusing without an agent to answer questions about the rental process. Yes, agents do provide a service…which at this time appears to be both overpriced and undervalued.

 **THE RENTAL MARKET SLOWDOWN**

This year there was a noticeable shift in the market: the summer season - which is usually highly competitive -  fell flat, leading many to believe that renters were waiting until August to avoid the broker fee. But the anticipated August rush never materialized, suggesting that something else had tampered with the market. One likely theory - based on the fact that ""student housing"" demand was hit hard - is that the cancellation with student visas has had a significant impact on the Boston market. And while that may be a one-off, the H1B visa changes threaten to make an even bigger impact.

Unlike L1 work visas (which import workers the U.S. feels are worthy of becoming American citizens), the H1B visa is used to temporarily import foreign labor as cheap replacements for their local counterparts. Since the year 2020, over 1.3 MILLION H1B visas have been granted. Frankly, I don't think people are even aware of how many of H1B visas holders are in the Boston area. To give an example, a client remarked that 4 out 5 people in of his department in the Boston area was here on H1B visas.

 While the hope is that H1B visa changes will help the job market locally, I think companies are more likely to simply return to hiring employees abroad. And *this* could have a significant impact on housing affordability in the Boston area (unlike the broker fee change, which long-term doesn't impact housing prices at all in my opinion).

 I don't know what the numbers are for the number of undocumented immigrants in the Boston area, and how many are leaving or getting deported. However, it is possible that the immigration policies of the current administration could also impact housing in the Boston area depending on the number of people who ultimately leave.

**ON A LIGHTER NOTE**

 I don't want to end on a negative note, so I decided to drop this in here:

 **Best Views in Boston**

 I've toured most of the high rises in Boston (many times over) and have seen some incredible views. My two personal favorites views are:

* East India Row towers (condo buildings)
* Devonshire (apartment complex)

 Coincidentally, neither of these properties offers in-unit laundry (which is a dealbreaker for some clients). The laundry for East India is in the basement, while Devonshire offers shared laundry rooms on every other floor. (There are exceptions: some of the East India units have added in-unit laundry, and the penthouse units in Devonshire have in-unit laundry as well.)

In another odd coincidence. my two favorite Boston pools are at Devonshire and East India. Devonshire has an amazing indoor pool on the 42nd floor, with sunset views of Boston Common and Back Bay. Meanwhile, East India has an outdoor pool with a large private area right on Boston Harbor.

Total cost: $100 or so for all transit, and I’d have to get to the hotel a night earlier because the event starts at 8am, and the train schedule wouldn’t get me there on time…so another $199 for the extra night in the room. Total would be $399 and the inconvenience of travel method. The room is reimbursed but I have to still pay for it up front. 


2. Drive down, only about 70 minutes. But have to deal with rush hour the morning the event starts, which means I’d probably leave at 5:30am to avoid the worst and possibly being late. Runs the risk of inclement weather problems. Pay $125 for valet parking at the hotel for 1 night and all the next day (that includes tips). I’d want to avoid the worst of traffic when the event is over at 4:30pm the next day as well. So I’d probably stick around, have dinner somewhere for an hour or two, and leave around 6:30/7. So maybe $45 for that. Total is a little less, closer to $170ish. Valet and dinner would not be reimbursed. 

So what’s your opinions? Avoid the stress of traffic and potential winter weather driving, take the train a night early? Or have the convenience of my own vehicle and my own timeline, but brave some of rush hour on both days and potentially have to drive on shitty roads?

From your experience, are the biggest challenges typically financial with medical procedures? One parent leaving their job, etc

We’ve got about 4 full days before heading out super early on the 8th.

My 7-year-old loves history — specifically presidents and their homes — and apparently John Adams is next on his prioritized list (don’t ask me how he came up with the order ). So Quincy is our main stop. We’ll also do the Freedom Trail, including the historic Chipotle, and since my wife has started her annual Hocus Pocus rewatch cycle, she’s insisting we take the ferry to Salem. Other places: Fenway, Cambridge, and Fort Warren. Might be more than we can realistically squeeze in, but we’ll see how far we get. We’re planning to use public transit the whole time with a stroller.

The big thing I could use advice on: where to stay. We’re looking for a neighborhood that works well as a home base with kids, and makes it easier to get around to all of the different areas. Someone suggested Little Italy (North End, right?) since it’s close to the Freedom Trail, but I’d love to hear feedback from those who know the city the best. Any other advice or recommendations is welcomed!

Also, is the Dunkin stereotype real? Am I legally obligated to visit at least one Dunkin Donuts while in town?

3. If youre near tufts, dont block the marked off intersection that's at kneeland st and Hudson st. Thats an artery to the emergency department that, in the last 3 emergency calls I got, was completely blocked by traffic when I had my lights and sirens on. Do not block that intersection.

I'm a Brit over in Boston for 2 days with only one afternoon to spare. Off the plane today, and into Downtown by 4pm.

Quick search of the sidebar and some customary searches warded me away from Faneuil and Quincy fairly quickly.

I couldn't be more grateful, as it took me straight to Paulie's.

One Classic lobster roll with Salt & Vinegar crisps.

Nigh on perfection. 

Unpretentious, quick, delicious. Worth the $29. 

About a coke can size worth of lobster in a toasted roll with a smattering of lemon mayo? Yes.

In the UK it would be sacrilegious to have lobster with a bag of chips, let alone that much lobster in a *hot dog bun*. But MAN. Does it work.

--

Deciding 'when in Rome', or rather 'when in North End'. Sail Loft was the natural choice for clam chowder.

30 minute wait for a table for 1? No chance.

Takeaway chowder from the packed bar, enjoyed from a harbour bench at the turn of dusk? Felt the better option.

Fresh, full of dill, and seasoned to perfection. $10? Well worth it.

Look, my benchmark of clam chowder was a single bowl in Anacortes 2 years ago, so I'm no authority on the matter. But wow, was it a vibe having that tub of chowder while watching the planes and the boats on a cloudless late afternoon.

I didn't necessarily take a scenic route back into downtown, but it was great to swing by some history at the Old South Meeting House, and take in some of the incredible architecture of area. 

The sheer brutalist design of City Hall being almost the anthesis to Faneuil is probably one of the most striking examples of historical and contemporary city architecture I've ever seen.

--

All in all, in the space of 4 hours I feel like I've had a (literal) taste of some 'local' food, and had a great chance to enjoy the small area I've walked around at my own pace.

I'm very thankful for it. Thanks for setting up such an easy to follow guide for people coming into the city!",https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1no1uh7/the_wiki_was_right_paulies_and_sail_loft_were/,NearlyLegit,1758583423.0,2025-09-22T19:23:43,30,215

I’m outlining the options below which I’ve been considering, as well as what notes I’ve taken for each: 

1. The Newbury Boston

pros: recently refurbished, EXCELLENT location (especially for Christmas, as it’s right on the Boston Commons and Newbury street), pricing is kind so I can aim for a top-level suite below presidential

cons: significantly lacking in amenities, lobby seems very small as it’s set in an old historical building

2. Raffles

pros: gorgeous rooms, excellent amenities. subtle asian/Singaporean influences throughout the hotel

cons: view from most rooms, and the service reviews are VERY mixed online. i see a fair number people who say that service is unpolished/slow from hotel staff and butlers, and that this Raffles does not live up to the global Raffles service standard 

3. The Langham 

pros: superb rooms, excellent club, very positive reviews about service and staff across the board

con: LOCATION. i want to be around Newbury/Commons, not in the financial district. but I’m open to getting convinced that this is neglegible, all else considered

4. Four Seasons Boylston

pros: good rooms, good location 

cons: similarly with Raffles, mixed reviews on the internet when it comes to service.

5. Four Seasons, One Dalton St

pros: price aside, probably the best reviews when considering rooms, service, amenities, and food

cons: location is slightly farther out from where I’d ideally want to stay, and pricing is a bit above my range. I can cough up enough for their most basic room, but I don’t know if I’d choose a basic room here over a suite at any other hotel mentioned above for roughly the same price point

1. Yes it is a largely symbolic bill that does not directly carry a dollar value behind it 

2. But this happens while MAGA is using the death of Kirk as an excuse to trample freedom of speech everywhere. This lends them legitimacy and credibility.

3. The Republicans don’t need him to pass this bill to please their conservative base. Yet Lynch still jump to the opportunity to cooperate with the goons and allow them to throw a big “bipartisan consensus” flag over this nauseous bill.

Honoring the life and legacy of Charles “Charlie” James Kirk.

Whereas Charles “Charlie” James Kirk, born October 14, 1993, was a courageous American patriot, whose life was tragically and unjustly cut short in an act of political violence on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University;

Whereas Charlie Kirk was a devoted Christian, who boldly lived out his faith with conviction, courage, and compassion;

Whereas Charlie Kirk was a dedicated husband to his beloved wife, Erika Kirk, and a loving father to their daughter and son, exemplifying the virtues of faith, fidelity, and fatherhood;

Whereas Charlie Kirk was a fierce defender of the American founding and its timeless principles of life, liberty, limited government, and individual responsibility;

Whereas Charlie Kirk, at 18 years old, founded Turning Point USA in 2012, a student movement with the mission to “identify, educate, train, and organize students to promote the principles of fiscal responsibility, free markets, and limited government”;

Whereas Charlie Kirk became one of the most prominent voices in America, engaging in respectful, civil discourse across college campuses, media platforms, and national forums, always seeking to elevate truth, foster understanding, and strengthen the Republic;

Whereas Charlie Kirk personified the values of the First Amendment, exercising his God-given right to speak freely, challenge prevailing narratives, and did so with honor, courage, and respect for his fellow Americans;

Whereas Charlie Kirk’s commitment to civil discussion and debate stood as a model for young Americans across the political spectrum, and he worked tirelessly to promote unity without compromising on conviction;

Whereas the assassination of Charlie Kirk was not only a heinous act of violence, but a sobering reminder of the growing threat posed by political extremism and hatred in our society;

Whereas such acts of politically motivated violence are antithetical to the principles of a free republic, in which differences of opinion are to be debated—not silenced—with civility, reason, and mutual respect;

Whereas the rise in targeted violence against individuals for their political beliefs undermines the very fabric of our constitutional democracy and chills the free exchange of ideas essential to a healthy civic society;

Whereas leaders at every level—government, education, media, and beyond—must stand united in unequivocal condemnation of political violence, regardless of their ideology;

Whereas the tragic loss of Charlie Kirk must not be allowed to deepen the divides in our Nation, but instead serve as a turning point to recommit ourselves to better angels, and to the timeless American principles of liberty governed by truth and the virtues of peaceful dialogue; and

Whereas Charlie Kirk would not have us respond to his death with despair, but rather with renewed purpose—to speak truth with courage, to stand firm in faith, to seek unity while standing firm in principle, and to serve as living reminders of the values he championed: faith, family, and freedom: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the assassination of Charles “Charlie” James Kirk, and all forms of political violence;

(2) commends and honors the dedicated law enforcement and emergency personnel for their tireless efforts in finding the suspect responsible for the assassination of Charlie Kirk and urges the administration of swift justice to the suspect;

(3) extends its deepest condolences and sympathies to Charlie Kirk’s family, including his wife, Erika, and their two young children, and prays for comfort, peace, and healing in this time of unspeakable loss;

(4) honors the life, leadership, and legacy of Charlie Kirk, whose steadfast dedication to the Constitution, civil discourse, and Biblical truth inspired a generation to cherish and defend the blessings of liberty; and

(5) calls upon all Americans—regardless of race, party affiliation, or creed—to reject political violence, recommit to respectful debate, uphold American values, and respect one another as fellow Americans.

A literary masterpiece this is not.       
 Well formatted it is not    
Well proofed- well, you get the idea.      
  
  
The most used word seems to be “I,” and the book spans over 40 short chapters. As a local celebrity, I had questions about Elliot that I hoped the book would answer.   
  
**Here’s my brief synopsis:**  
  
Despite the frequent use of “I,” the book is actually about Elliot’s late fiancé and his reflections on his life when they were together. It’s a world I was completely out of touch with. The book details the struggles of addiction and intermittent attempted recovery, but honestly, there isn’t much of a struggle with addiction, it’s sort of embraced like an old friend. The book reads like a life that just happens we’re on a set of tracks that just chug along with no reflection nor great explanation—one day, Elliot realizes he’s tipped over the addiction edge, quits his job to not burn employment bridges, and trades his apartment and cars for a life of drugs and fix-a-flat.    
  
 There’s no redemption arc or moment of clarity. Elliot’s world becomes pretty plain to everyone but the author. Perhaps Elliot knew what the rest of us were thinking, but it’s a world we’re lucky enough not to be in.  
  
By the end, I felt bad for Veronica. She didn’t deserve her fate, and I felt for Elliot too, but I don’t see how he could look at that ending and not get his act together.  
  
**What I Learned:**  
•Surprise, surprise, Elliot is self-centered and arrogant.  
•He’s extremely religious.  
•He’s not afraid to engage with local government and has volunteered at the city level. If someone could channel his energy into something productive, like ballot initiatives or candidate turfing they’d both do well.  
•He has family including a brother he thinks highly of, though no children are mentioned. His fiancé had several children, but there’s no indication of a relationship with them.  
•He’s open about spending time in jail—at least nine months by my count.  
•He’s homeless, which was a shocker to me. I assumed he was more of a grifter than a panhandler, given his well-kept appearance. I always got the Peter from Office Space vibe with a shitty 9-5 down town under some middle manager like Lumbergh and striking out a side hustle like someone might do tech support or photo gigs in their free time.
  
His stories leave a lot out. As an example, he was trespassed from BMC for being “too involved” in his fiancé’s medical care. I find this dubious and presume he lacks self-awareness or is too arrogant to admit his role.  
  
**Overall:**  
Terrible read, but a unique story. I’d love to see a second version with more detail and self-awareness. The book feels like Elliot is dumping a stream of consciousness rather than telling a planned story.
  
**Would I Recommend It?**  
If you’re curious or have two hours to kill waiting for the red line? Go ahead.   
If you’re looking for something to sweep you into an alternate reality? Skip  
If you want the book to teach you something, the point blank life of an addict is an eyebrow raiser. I’d recommend it for someone looking into humanitarian aid and social services.",https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1nl8wyn/i_read_elliot_daviss_book_something_with_you_so/,Drix22,1758300781.0,2025-09-19T12:53:01,66,251

Dear Friends,

We have important news regarding the future of downtown development. This Thursday at 3:30 PM, the BPDA Board will be holding a vote on the Boston Planning Department’s proposed amendment to the downtown zoning. The Friends have significant concerns about how the allowable building heights will impact the future vitality of Boston’s iconic downtown parks.

Register for the meeting here.

Only elected officials will be able to comment at the Board Meeting, which means the voice of our community is especially critical in this moment. 

We urge you to reach out to your elected officials or share your concerns in writing with the BPDA board members ahead of Thursday's meeting.

We are grateful to Senator Nick Collins, Representatives Jay Livingstone and Aaron Michlewitz, and City Councilors Ed Flynn and Erin Murphy for their critical support of the three parks.

Our Board Chair, Leslie Singleton Adam, emphasizes the significance of this moment for the city:

""This new zoning will set the course of development downtown for the next generation. As allowable building heights jump from 155' to 500' or 700', we need protections for public parks that respond to this increased scale of development so that our city's natural and built environments can thrive together.

The State Shadow Laws were enacted 35 years ago during a different chapter in our city, and we now need to strengthen them with local shadow regulations. Today we have the technology and scientific research to help us understand the real landscape and human health impacts that can come from overshadowing. It is irresponsible to the next generation in our city to grant these building heights without protecting our shared public spaces from the cumulative shadow impacts that will be unlocked with this new zoning.""
 


The Friends has provided a letter to the Planning Department and elected officials, articulating our request for additional sunlight protections for the parks in better balance with proposed building heights. Read the Friends letter here.

A Coalition of downtown stakeholders, of which the Friends is a member, has also released an Open Letter to the Mayor advocating for our shared vision for a thriving downtown and identifying where the current zoning proposal falls short. Read the Coalition letter here.

We invite you to stand with us in advocating for the protection and enhancement of our parks. Together, we can ensure they remain vibrant, ecologically healthy and welcoming for generations to come.

Why this matters:

Sunlight supports health, safety, and civic identity. Parks like Boston Common and the Public Garden provide irreplaceable green space for all and will not continue to thrive if they are cast in shadow throughout the year.
Growth and sunlight are not mutually exclusive. With more thoughtful zoning downtown can evolve and prosper without sacrificing sunshine for the neighborhoods and public spaces in the core of our city.
We are at an inflection point: Boston Common is America’s first public park, and as the nation approaches its 250th anniversary, the choices made now will decide what future generations inherit. This moment demands vision and stewardship—not shortcuts or shadows.
How you can help:

Reach out to your elected officials (listed below) and let them know that you stand with the Friends and the Coalition to protect the Common and Garden. 
Reach out in writing to BPDA Board members before Thursday. You can find their contact information here. 
Attend the virtual meeting on Thursday. Register here.
Spread the word by sharing this message with friends and family.

I see this little old lady suuuper hunched over using a walker crossing the street. I was kinda squinting to get a better look bc she was walking so weird. But then suddenly the walker is somehow flattened into a bunch of pieces skidding all over the road and I was confused. 

Then I realized a car just smashed into the lady going fast as FUCK. The car stops and pulls over and the driver gets out and throws up. The lady that got hit somehow got up real fast and stumbles over to the homeless guy standing right next to my car, with her arms held out but they’re all bent and crumpled. 

Then my dang light turns green and the truck in front of me kinda real slowly starts pulling away so I just followed him. I called 911 on my way home but I hate that I’m never gonna know what happened after that and if she’s okay. But there’s no way she’s okay

My theatre company is producing a show in Somerville on Tuesday October 28th (Richard III) and we're looking for a space to rehearse the night before, Monday October 27th.

As a small group of broke actors, our budget for renting rehearsal space is always minimal, and I was hoping that someone might have a lead on a space that wouldn't show up on Google searches. I'm already sending a lot of cold emails to churches, bars with back rooms, etc.

All we need is a decent-sized room (500 sq ft or more would be amazing). Our shows don't use any tech, so we don't need lights and we won't be loading in a bunch of set pieces and costumes. It'll just be eight dorks walking around yelling old-timey poetry for a few hours.

If anyone has access to a warehouse, a basement, or any other room we could use for the night, we would be very grateful.

Thank you

I first noticed her about a week ago, when I bought a bracelet from her. She was with a woman I assumed was her mom. She looked unhappy, but I thought maybe she was just shy. Since then, I’ve seen her a couple more times yesterday and today.
Today she was with a different adult, a man who didn’t interact with her and seemed to be of a different ethnicity. That made me doubt he was her father. She looked sad again, wearing old, loose clothes. She has straight blonde hair and looked maybe around 12 years old, carrying a big container full of bracelets.
Has anyone else seen her or know anything about her? I am debating reporting this as a potential case of child abuse or neglect, but I’m not sure how to go about it or if I’m overreacting.
If anyone has seen her too, or has advice on whether and how to report, I would really appreciate it. I’d rather be overly cautious than ignore something that could be serious.

**UPDATE**: I've called the National Human Trafficking Hotline. I'm on the line waiting to be connected with an advocate. I will update the post after the call. Thank you everyone that commented.

**UPDATE 2**: After a long wait, I was able to speak with an advocate at the National Human Trafficking Hotline. They said it would be best to call the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) since the report was child related. I then called NCMEC, but they didn't take a report. They said it would be best to contact the local authorities or the police, which was very disappointing. Shortly after, I got a call (unrelated) from daycare saying that my kid was sick, so I wasn't able to follow up. I intend to call the Boston Police non-emergency line, as someone suggested below, as soon as I have the chance. Any other suggestions are welcome! And I really appreciate everyone who gave me helpful advice and encouraged me to report. I can't stop thinking about her, now that so many others have confirmed my suspicions!

**UPDATE 3:** I made a report to DCF, and they told me they’ll try to identify the family, but that with the limited information I gave them, it might be difficult (no address, very common name and possibly fake). I gave them the name Jasmine Vargas, since that’s the name on the Venmo/CashApp accounts. They also told me that the most effective way to handle this is to call 911 if I see her again, so the police can speak with her directly and properly identify her. 
So please **if anyone sees her call 911 to report it and tell them DCF needs more information.** You can also call DCF directly (800-792-5200), according to another redditor, they may be able to come right away in that situation.

Well, there's one company that I kept seeing, posting on pretty much all the job search sites, with the postings clearly constantly being refreshed because they always showed up as being posted in the last few days.

I was getting bad, predatory vibes and Googled the company - I didn't see the best reviews from former employees and there were definitely some concerns, but last week, I decided what the heck, I can see for myself how it is, and at the very least maybe I’ll get to practice my interviewing skills, so I applied.

I got an ""interview"" that was basically telling me about the company and the job, then asking me like 2 surface level questions that gave them no sense of me as a person or employee.

Then, I was offered a job.

The pay is bad and non negotiable. Like, what I'd made with a few years less experience \*and\* before I got licensures/certifications that are associated with a like 50% pay bump. Sure, I could \*survive\* off the pay, but I couldn't save for retirement or even really build back the emergency fund I've dipped into, etc.

\*And\* I would be trapped with being unable to supplement the low pay because the contract says I'd have to get the company's permission to do any other work. Doesn't matter if it were outside work hours and in no way competing with or a conflict of interest with my work for them (think not even be able to give a training, etc.).

There are also no professional upsides/perks - no opportunities to collaborate with colleagues, to network, or in any way grow professionally or strengthen my resume. Plus, even if I'm proactive about trying to engage with coworkers, given the ""interview"" and the bad pay, I worry that the company attracts a decent amount of employees who are naive, desperate, and/or just really don't care about their work and doing their job well.

The final concern is that a lot of the backend onboarding stuff takes time, so I wouldn't even be able to start for like 8 weeks. I'd just be sitting around dreading my start date.

Genuinely, the only reason I'd take the job is because I'm assuming that I'll lose unemployment if I turn it down.

If I'm being honest, I feel like I'm headed toward a psych hospitalization at this point - either from the stress of losing unemployment or from signing on with a company that clearly just wants to use me and exploit me in a way that triggers an extensive trauma history. Like, I feel like I'm being forced to take a job that I might not even be able to do because of how badly my mental health might tank. And I've never felt that way about a job before; I've never had a job trigger my trauma history. And I really can't afford an inpatient stay right now.

Sometimes called “*Crisis Pregnancy Centers*” or “*Pregnancy Resource Centers*”- on the surface, these are centers that present themselves as resources for people facing unplanned pregnancies, but in reality, often exist to dissuade people from accessing abortion care. 

They’re often managed and funded by organizations that oppose abortion in any and all circumstances. They sometimes use abortion stigma and medical disinformation to try to prevent people from accessing abortion care.

**Across New England, these anti-abortion centers outnumber legitimate abortion clinics 3 to 1**, which means it’s very likely you’ve driven past one in your community without even realizing it.

📖 If you’re interested in learning more, there’s a toolkit that breaks down:

* What these centers are,
* How they often operate
* How to spot them

[👉 https://reproequitynow.org/aac-guidebook](https://reproequitynow.org/aac-guidebook)

The Reproductive Equity Now Foundation is working to expose the centers that lean on anti-abortion tactics to delay and prevent people from seeking the health care they want, need, and deserve. One of the most effective ways of doing this is through **storytelling**.

Storytelling:

* Raises awareness and educates folks in your community
* Destigmatizes the experience for others
* Helps us increase access to abortion care.  

# ❓So we want to know: Have you or someone you know ever visited one of these centers? What was your experience with these centers? How did the experience impact you?

My best friend in the world is really struggling. She had movers scheduled for today, but they cancelled this morning. This woman has seen me through some of my darkest days, and now she's beside herself. So I'm crowdsourcing. I'm on the other side of the state and it's breaking my heart to know that she's all alone over there with a big job ahead of her. Many hands make light work, so I'm hoping to find some hands and some trucks. Happy to Venmo cash to the helpers. Today would be ideal, but she has until September 30 to have everything out of her current place.

I realize that it's a big ask already, and hoping that one or more of you Good Samaritans has a truck is adding to that, but we could always arrange a U-Haul if someone was willing to pick it up.

Details: She's in Lee (two floors, duplex, raised property with steps from street) and going to Pittsfield (second-floor apartment in a house with a driveway). She mainly wants to get her furniture over - there's a huge sofa, a bed, a couple of desks, and a bunch of shelves. If boxes can go too, that would be great. There are boxes and also zip-up totes. But the furniture is the important thing. 

Now, y'all, my friend has a LOT of stuff. Like, a hoarding level of stuff. It's not creepy, like animal carcasses under piles of trash, but the stacks and stacks of boxes can be overwhelming to be around. The spaces are tight. She doesn't need the house emptied today, just the furniture to come out. 

I've lived in this great state for nine years, and I continue to be moved by the kindness of others around here. Thanks, y'all. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1npfx0q/emergency_moving_help_in_the_berkshires/,meltycheddar,1758729322.0,2025-09-24T11:55:22,10,37

To those of you from MA, do you have any suggestions or things you’d like someone originally from out-of-state to know that would make being friends with them easier?

It hit me the other day that I am so ridiculously lonely and sad… and also, how much I’ve struggled to make friends since moving here. It became *especially* evident when I had to ask my next-door neighbor to take me to and from an important medical procedure, because I had no one else who could. And as I sat there preparing for the procedure without anyone beside me. 
It doesn’t help matters that I’ve become relatively chronically ill since I moved here in 2022 and that I’m a little neurodivergent.

Im not sure - it’s obvious the market is picking up with the fed rate cut and I feel like this is a solid buyer but not really a great offer.  Might pass - not sure if a counter will work as it would probably upset them. Are we wrong to not take an asking offer?

I was extremely disappointed to see my Congressional Rep Katherine Clark vote Yes to honor Charlie Kirk. The only MA reps who voted No were Moulton and Pressley.

As a member of the GBLT community, I was concerned that he campaigned and debated against same sex marriage and gender affirming care. More concerning, he talked about Leviticus 20:13 which advocates stoning gay people. 

I'm not sure why she would vote for this. I was expecting Moulton to have more backbone.

For you nit pickers out there, yes I mean fckin BLINKERSSSS


For god sake!!! pls use your indicator lights. It can prevent lots of accidents. Also I see some people use their indicators briefly which is of no use at all.

There are 4 types of indicator people I generally see on road:
1. One that uses it to safely take permission and change lanes
2. One that gives a heads up and does their thing
3. One that flashes it for micro second just for the sake of it
4. One that doesn’t use it.

Pls aim to be the 1st and 2nd kind.

We’d love recommendations for beautiful-but-affordable venues in Massachusetts or Rhode Island. We’re aiming for Spring–Fall 2027 with 130–140 guests, ceremony outside and reception inside.

Budget context We’ll have $18–20k from family, and the rest is out-of-pocket. We’d rather keep total costs reasonable so we can also save for a house. So far what we’re seeing is $30–35k for venue/catering alone, before adding DJ, photo/video, décor, cake, attire, etc. We’re hoping to avoid anything that pushes us into $50k+ all-in.

What we’ve toured: Lakeside Pavilion (Foxborough, MA) The Villa (Bridgewater, MA) Both are lovely, but end up around $30–35k just for the basics, which puts us over once we add other vendors.

Must-haves: Outdoor ceremony, indoor reception (weather backup is key) Space that allows a memorable ceremony walk-in/aisle (we’re not doing a first look, so the entrance is really important) Fits 130–140 comfortably Within MA or RI

Nice-to-haves: On-site getting-ready space Scenic grounds for portraits Inclusive packages (or flexible enough to bring in budget-friendly vendors)

The ask: What venues in MA/RI offered you a beautiful outdoor ceremony + indoor reception without hitting $50k all-in? Any places with reasonable food & beverage minimums, daytime/brunch packages, or off-peak discounts you loved? Hidden gems like community centers, lodges, historic homes, museums, universities, nature centers, state parks with lodges, or private estates/barns that don’t break the bank? Venues with in-house coordination/decor options that helped you keep rental costs low? Any spots known for a long aisle or dramatic entrance?

Other details We’ll still need DJ, photographer, cake, décor, dresses/suit & accessories, etc., so keeping venue/catering in a sane range is huge for us. Flexible on month/day, as long as it’s Spring–Fall 2027.

Drop your venue names, packages you booked, approx. cost breakdowns, and any tips to keep total spend down (minimum guest counts, vendor lists, corkage policies, in-house rentals, etc.).

Dear Littleton Families

I have heard from many of you regarding the district’s recent statement on political violence. I also commend, and thank, those of you who attended Thursday night’s School Committee meeting and communicated your concerns.  I want to begin by acknowledging and respecting the concerns that have been raised. Many have asked why a statement was made in this case and not including other tragedies, such as school shootings or the deaths of other public figures. This is valid feedback. I chose not to speak at Thursday’s meeting as a result of Chairman McCarthy’s reading of a public statement. Upon reflection, I missed an opportunity to reaffirm that I agreed with the Chair’s statement and apologize for my missteps in the messaging to the community. That email was intended to bring the community together and offer support for our students, but instead, it created hurt, frustration, and disappointment. I hear your concerns and the need for improved communication, and I am committed to addressing these issues.

I deeply regret that the message, which was intended to unite the community, had the opposite effect. I had received a request that was an intended suggestion from Chairman McCarthy asking me to consider making a joint statement condemning political violence, and he also provided me with a sample communication. We typically refrain from communications that go beyond any impact that is happening directly to our own community. After reading the communication and focusing on the intent of supporting our students who will have seen the very public incident earlier that day, I mistakenly felt that issuing a statement to the community condemning violence was worth sharing, considering the polarized environment we are all trying to make sense of.  However, the content of the message was incomplete and not fully reflective of that intent.  This was a huge misstep. Although the intent may have been good, the message was not inclusive to all community members, and therefore, its impact was hurtful and harmful, and for that, I am deeply sorry. 

What I missed incorporating into the message and should have added is that we do not condone violence of any nature. And that we extend our thoughts and deep condolences to all of the families who have been affected by violence in this way. We know that the current political environment and recent violence are creating divisiveness within our country and communities, and I am deeply sorry for the divisiveness that the message created within our own community.  The message should have expressed the district’s condemnation of violence against all political figures, as well as students who have recently suffered these tragedies, and not just one, and reaffirmed our commitment to supporting the community and our students in processing the many tragedies that continue to take place. I want to reassure you that our commitment to supporting the community and our students remains unwavering.

After much reflection, I am recommending to the School Committee that we create a policy on Non-operational Communication, outlining a process that requires the School Committee to vet any non-operational communication in a public session before releasing it to the community. No communication should be approved unless the circumstances clearly warrant that the community needs to be informed about an area of concern that falls beyond the operational responsibilities of the district.

With the increased violent acts that we are seeing across our nation and beyond I have grave concerns about the potential negative effects that it may have on our students. If you would like access to resources that focus on processing violent events with your child/children please contact your child’s school’s guidance department and they can provide you with the necessary resources and supports. I have attached a resource that may be helpful to facilitate difficult discussions with your child/children.

As a district, we will continue to emphasize our core values in everything that we do: Respect, Integrity, Responsibility and Accountability.

___
The Pilgrims landed at what's now Plymouth, MA on **December 21, 1620**...one month *after* they landed at what's now Provincetown, MA.

This means that, at best, Plymouth Rock is the place where the Pilgrims ~~first~~ *second* set foot onto the New World.

The rock doesn't seem to have held significant importance to the Pilgrims, though, as there's no mention of anything like Plymouth Rock for *95 YEARS*, when, in 
**1715,** a written town boundary for Plymouth referred to a ""great rock"".

All was quiet on the rock front for 30 MORE YEARS, until, in **1745,** a 94-year-old man named Thomas Faunce claimed that the ""great rock"" was where the Pilgrims ""landed"", an event that happened 25 years before he was born. 

It's probably worth mentioning that, even though he was a town record keeper and the son of a settler who had arrived only 3 years after the Pilgrims, it wasn't until a wharf was proposed to be built over the rock that he decided to bring up—remember, at *94 years old*—the whole ""this is where our forefathers landed"".

Whether fact, partial fact, misremembered and/or convenient fiction, the good people of Plymouth saw the old man in a carried chair give a weeping farewell to a big rock, and they decided that the ""great rock"" *actually was an important part of their heritage*, and they preserved it.

Well, for a few decades, at least.

In **1774,** a group of patriotic townsfolk decided to move the rock from the shore to the center of town...as a symbol of liberty (because that makes sense, somehow?). Unfortunately, they accidentally **split the rock in two**, and so they opted to leave one part of it on the shore.

Fear not, though, because they decided that the ""split"" made for even *greater* symbolism in that it represented the desire of the colonies to ""split"" from England (a metaphor that is at least less ~~rocky~~ tenuous than whatever metaphor was originally intended).

Plymouth decided to move the town part of the rock again in **1834**, from in front of one museum to another, and, this time, **it fell from a cart and broke into two MORE pieces** (no symbolism was declared in the making of this incident). 

In **1880,** the  town part of the rock was melded/rejoined to the part on the shore (and had ""1620"" carved into it), but, by that time, an estimated **two-thirds of the overall rock had been lost**, much of it chipped away from both sections of the rock by souvenir hunters.

One piece of the rock was deemed ""too large"" to fit under the canopy that had been built to house it (which suggests poor measuring, a concern that the small enclosure wouldn't allow the rock enough freedom to move around, or the worry that the rock would simply be too big for the sanity of the visitors), and it was kept as one of the multiple pieces of the rock in the museum's collection. 

The 1880 canopy had settler bones interned within it, and it was designed to allow certain visitors access to **SIT upon the rock**, which undoubtedly wore it down further. That canopy was replaced in **1920** when Plymouth's waterfront was redesigned, which resulted in the water-level housing that the rock can be seen in today.

For some reason, parts of the old canopy were simply tossed into the harbor during the overhaul, only to be dredged up in 1968 when the harbor breakwater was built. Parts of the old canopy can now be found in variety of locations—just like the rock itself.

> Plymouth rock pieces have turned up in some interesting places:
> 
> - A piece stolen in the 1840s currently resides in Brooklyn's Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims.
> 
> - In the 1920s, 400 lbs of the rock were found being used as a doorstop at a Plymouth house. The Plymouth Antiquarian Society broke it into 3 pieces (deliberately, for once), and they gave the Smithsonian 100 lbs of it.
> 
> - The Smithsonian has a 2nd piece that was broken off & painted on by a descendant of William Bradford (Pilgrim and governor of the colony) in 1850.
> 
> - Another piece chipped away in 1850 is currently over the door to The New England Building at Vassar College in New York.
> 
> - A tiny piece of the rock was attached to the top of the parade grand marshal’s baton for the 300th Anniversary of Plymouth in 1920.

**Visually, Plymouth rock is incredibly disappointing.**

What the public can see is 4 tons of rock with a pronounced scar and a chiseled date. Beneath the sand is another 6 tons, but it's never visible.

In its heyday, it's estimated that Plymouth Rock weighed between 40 and 200 tons and measured about 15-feet long and 3-feet wide.

It's a shadow of its former self.

But the thing is, it's survived multiple dumb moves and countless acts of selfishness and greed, all motivated by a story that's probably not entirely true. It's also withstood numerous acts of vandalism from the 1930s through the 2020s. 

And yet it endures.  It has a history all of its own now.

**That's pretty inspiring, if you think about it.**

Plus, you know, it's free to see. And aren't ""free"" and ""freedom"" ultimately what it's all about?",https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1nh62dd/in_defense_of_plymouth_rock_a_history/,Digresser,1757891985.0,2025-09-14T19:19:45,36,78

The Massachusetts Flag, Seal, and Motto Commission is in the middle of picking a new state flag. This is supposed to be a once-in-centuries chance to give the Bay State a symbol that actually represents who we are today. But here’s the problem:

- Commissioners themselves admitted the scoring rubric was flawed. 80% of the criteria focused on design polish, while only 1 metric dealt with meaning or representation.
- Even worse, Commissioner Elizabeth Solomon admitted at the August 28 meeting that “multiple people scored differently… [commissioners] were already scoring things the way they thought was best.” In other words, there wasn’t even consistency in how the rubric was applied.
- The designs now being advanced? Feathers, a flower with Mayflower connotations that commissioners themselves flagged as harmful, and a generic wave–land–star motif that could be any coastal state.

Massachusetts is more than that. We’re home to the nation’s highest concentrations of Moroccans, Brazilians, and Ugandans by percentage, along with deep Irish, Italian, African American, Asian American, and Indigenous roots. Our flag should be a civic banner for all Bay Staters, not one that feels narrow or generic.

That’s why I started this petition: 👉 https://chng.it/9PDfpsXgVx

We’re asking Gov. Healey and the commission to:

1.	⁠Rebalance the rubric so meaning and symbolism matter as much as graphic neatness.
2.	⁠Reopen consideration of strong designs that may have been unfairly excluded.
3.	⁠Aim for universal, timeless symbols — like Minnesota’s new flag, which uses the state’s shape, the North Star, and lake colors to represent everyone.

Deadlines aren’t an excuse to rush a decision that could last centuries. As Secretary Tutweiler himself said in August: “Reliability is important.”

If you care about having a flag that actually represents Massachusetts — all of us — please add your name and share.",https://chng.it/9PDfpsXgVx,morning_cuppa_joe,1757541702.0,2025-09-10T18:01:42,3,0

This is the fourth legislative session in which our bills have been introduced, and the issue is more urgent than ever (especially with other states like Florida moving in the opposite direction), so we are trying to make sure that legislators understand that these bills really are popular! We are grateful to Governor Healey and the Massachusetts DPH for their recent leadership on COVID vaccine access, and hope that the legislature will take this next step to improve herd immunity across Massachusetts.

H.2554 has advanced out of the Public Health Committee, but S.1557 is still waiting for a vote there, so one of our priorities right now is reaching out to senators on the Committee.

I work in a local shop and my boss has always been… interesting. She’s poorly managing our shop. 

 I get paid a tipped wage ($7.50 an hour) and my tips, cash and credit card, make up the other half of my wage so I still get paid $15 an hour (and she makes up the different if not). 

I find this not an illegal method of payment but just an odd one because my tips are never an added benefit on top of my wage since they’re factored in. 

Also I have not been paid in almost a month. And she still owes another girl over $300.

We live 1.6 miles from the school, and because we fall just under the 2-mile eligibility threshold, he has been denied access to school transportation. As a family that currently faces financial hardships, we cannot afford private transportation, leaving Elias's education and safety in jeopardy.

Elias's predicament is not an isolated case. Numerous families in Saugus, particularly those who are low-income or single-parent households, find themselves in similarly dire situations. They are forced to make difficult decisions between their children's education and their safety due to a policy that does not consider individual hardships. Many of these routes are unsafe for children to walk, increasing the risk of accidents and dangerous encounters.

Education is a fundamental right, and access to it should not be dependent on arbitrary boundaries that don't account for real-world challenges. We are calling on the Saugus School District to reevaluate and amend its transportation policy. By lowering the transportation eligibility distance and incorporating considerations for families facing financial difficulties or unsafe walking routes, many children in Saugus like Elias will have a fairer chance at a safe and accessible education.

By making these adjustments, we can ensure that all children have the right to safely access education, regardless of their family's income or household structure. We urge the Saugus School District to take these necessary steps to create a more inclusive and safe environment for our children.

Please sign this petition to support a change in Saugus's school transportation policy, ensuring that no child is left unsafe or unable to receive their education simply due to where they live.

My vehicle was reversed into after a door dasher finished her order. My car was legally parked on the street and I have video evidence of her hitting me. The cops were able to find her. 

The third party insurance adjuster for Doordash (Liberty Mutual) explained that her dash had finished at 4:28 pm and she hit me between 4:30 pm and 4:33 pm, making the drivers personal insurance (Geico) liable.

It's been 3 weeks since I have been hit and submitted all evidence to the police, doordash, and probably about 2 weeks since Geico was given all the evidence.

People here are direct and blunt it’s often tough love, and some of it is genuinely helpful. But I realized, especially when I was at my lowest, that some people exploit that same cultural expectation to actually push vulnerable people around. It’s not everyone, and people are indeed kind, but a category of people misuse and exploit this culture as a shield to justify hostile behavior.
This happens everywhere: in institutions like doctors’ offices, schools, housing, court systems, and hospitals. Some expats, some mentally ill, and others just want to feel superior use the “we’re just blunt here” excuse to intimidate, control, or push and bully someone who’s already struggling.

My cat is 10 years old and for the last couple years he has been having back spasms which cause him to attack his own tail. A more accurate word is “Maul” because he rips fur and flesh out, and has even exposed bone at times according to my wife (She has had him since before we were together) requiring immediate veterinary attention.

The vet had initially suggested amputation, which we had hoped to avoid, as we wanted him to keep his tail of course, and at the beginning it wasn’t as bad as it has become lately. 

The vet could not diagnose the issue, but thinks it is feline hyperesthesia, and despite that has been giving him monthly shots of solensia (which is used to treat osteoarthritis pain) which my wife thought were helping at first, but in the last year he seems to be going after his tail worse than ever, leaving our kitchen covered in blood despite having a cone on and his tail being bandaged at the time. We have done everything in our power but at this point we think the amputation may be the only way. We love our boy and would love to save his tail and quality of life, and are open to any other suggestions, just please if anyone knows anything that can help, write it below!!

I guess what I am asking is does anyone have experience with this kind of issue? And/or know of any reliable local vets that may charge less than ours? ($960)",https://i.redd.it/rcymksztdznf1.jpeg,Quapo99,1757354718.0,2025-09-08T14:05:18,10,16

Partner and I are not a fan of tourist season or crowds and I read late March or early April or early September are less crowded (input on that would be great too).

More info:
-----------
· We’re used to traffic (lived in LA for a long time), we’re used to cold weather (lived in Midwest for 6 years).

· We love the American Revolution, not so interested in the battlefields, unless it’s really recommended.

· We love hiking; we’re about intermediate level, but we’d like to keep it around 6 miles for a day trip, so if anyone has a better recommendation than Mount Greylock, please share! Otherwise, I’m kind of set on it.

· We like to mix local experiences with the tourist experiences.

Questions:
------------
· Are these house tours worth it? We absolutely loved the house tours of Monticello, Mt. Vernon, and the house Lincoln died in.

· How is public transit? Partner and I are accustomed to public transit i.e. he was well versed with LA public transit and I with SF. Or should we just rent a car? I’m sure we’ll need one to get to Mount Greylock.

· Is it possible to do Salem and Lizzie Borden house in one day or is that too much?

Please take a look at my preliminary itinerary and would love any input! We’ve never been to Massachusetts so I’m wondering if this seems feasible or impossible (like when people say they want to do Universal Studios and Disneyland the same day). Also, I’d like to use Boston as a home base so all this travel would involve going back to Boston as opposed to staying at different places every night—unless this seems like a bad idea than I’m willing to change that.

 

Day 1: Arrival in Boston. Dinner at the Green Dragon Tavern.

Day 2: Salem Exploration

We live next to a HMO in Romsey and it's just so noisy. We do live in a 1930s terrace which doesn't have the best sound insulation, but equally we've had students who aren't a bother which suggests it's a people problem rather than just insulation.

After a couple of years of considerate tenants we're back to constant screaming and slamming (and I mean wall shaking) from 11-3am every night. Also mild annoyances like using our dropped kerb as their personal parking spot.

We've had a quote for full back to bricks sound insulation and decoration which is £20k+ just for downstairs, which won't resolve upstairs, which would presumably be another 20k. We've decided we need to move which is shit but we can't control them we can only control what we do next.

We had planned to move last year but had to care for a terminally ill family member, and I also have some ongoing medical issues. I also have PTSD I'm being treated for so the loud noises waking me up are a treat. 

Aside from speaking with them, we've tried all the usual, estate agent, council, councillor, university (ARU) The neighbours themselves literally said we should be 'kinder' as they're students. Not sure what to do with that information. They then proceeded to stand out in the street two nights later drunkenly screaming that we should go and fuck ourselves. That's not very kind, haha.

Anyways, am I missing something? I thought our MP, but what could they do? Doesn't seem extreme enough for police. I just need to get through the next six months while we put the house on the market and move. Currently it's like sleep roulette and my mental health is deteriorating 😭

The girl was walking quickly in front of them but they were close behind her and she wasn’t looking at them. They were walking the opposite direction to me so I didn’t have a lot of time to react until they were already past me and I didn’t feel I could intervene without putting me and her in danger (I am also 20s female). I made a police report as soon as I was at the bus stop but I wish I had done something more in the moment. I can’t stop thinking about her.

Given that my girlfriend and I were also the victims of a hate crime on Midsummer Common after dark, I don’t think that general area is safe after dark. It needs to be better lit and have more security cameras. Is there a way I can speak to the council about this issue?

That offer lasts until October 31st.

With the **Nicholsons** app, you can get a pint of Madri in the Mitre. Not a great pub, not a great pint. But the price! This seems to be running indefinitely.

And this week only, with the **Young's** one, get a free pint of Young's Original at The Brew House, The Old Bicycle Shop, The Old Ticket Office, The Station Tavern, The Waterman, The Tivoli, The Mill, The Petersfield or, if you're near Histon, the Red Lion.

And so far all the other software developers/ AI+ ML engineers I've met are men. I didn't think it to be this bad (in the States where I've moved from at least you would see 20%-30% women in most settings), so I am seriously wondering where are the women SWE at in this city. 

It will be good if someone knows a group from their workplace or outside, but even just informal social group of friends would be fine! And by saying women groups I don't mean the gender strictly, it's more as an inclusive environment where not everyone is into watching sports or board games, and are open to discuss feminism issues.

* Frequent train or tube service into Central London

We work in London, considering a move to Cambridge. We love Cambridge, have lived there before, and would like our son to grow up there (he's 3 now). But, it's far from work and we are likely to remain employed in London (no perspective of jobs in Cambridge). We'd need to commute to office 2x a week.

We're looking at places in Trumpington, it looks like it's a quick cycle to the station, but the bus (for rain days) is a good 25 mins

In London, work is in Waterloo area. About 20 min cycle (foldable bicycle to take in train), but public transport easily 30 mins.

Given that trains are 50-70 minutes, total time would be 1h30 hours in best case scenario, closer to 2h15 on bad days. One way.

Are we crazy to consider this?

We currently live in a small town in Kent, so no stranger to commuting, but it's much closer to London. But IMO quality of life is much better in Cambridge, for things that I care about (e.g. cycling to school and diversity of people). Also, housing is expensive in Cambridge. But it's also not cheap in London or commuter towns around it.

Any thoughts from folks in similar situation? TIA

  
\--- EDIT ---

Many thanks for the lovely and insightful replies! 

Thankfully we both have flexible office hours so can take off-peak trains. On the other hand, if train is very full from Cambridge then working on the train seems tricky. 

And I had completely forgotten about Cambridge South station, that's even a shorter bicycle ride.

I lived in Cambridge in 2014, and was working, not a student. One thing I really like about Cambridge specifically for children is that cycling is so normalised and safe, so kids can go to school cycling which IMO is really good for their independence and confidence. This is not possible in most towns or cities in UK, unfortunately.

I was cycling along the Cam early Saturday morning (trying to beat the tourist crowds near the colleges), and I decided to take a detour down the path behind Fen Ditton.

Sat there for a good hour just reading, and it was pure bliss.

It got me thinking—after all these years, Cambridge still surprises me with these quiet, perfect little spots. The kind of place you’d want to share with someone special on a lazy weekend.

So, what’s your favourite hidden gem in or around Cambridge? The place that feels like *yours*, where you can escape the hustle and just breathe?

Funding mostly goes to mums groups, which makes sense, but dads deserve safe spaces too. Trying to raise awareness and build something locally, starting with Romsey Mill.

Over the last few weeks I’ve been talking to local community centres in Cambridge, including Romsey Mill, and one thing keeps coming up. Most of the small funding available has to go to mums groups. And I get it. Mums often carry the bulk of daily care, they’re usually the first to seek help, and on average they tend to do better at parenting. So support for them makes sense.

But if funding only goes to mums, where does that leave dads? We’re trying to break cycles and show up for our kids, but often we’re left to figure it out alone. No safe spaces, no proper resources, and that impacts our families too. It doesn’t make sense to leave dads behind when a present and switched-on dad can genuinely change a child’s life.

I’m not saying money should be taken away from mums. What I’m pushing for is that dads get proper support too. Real spaces where we can talk openly, learn from each other, and get tools to actually change the story for our families. That’s what I’m trying to build locally here in Cambridge, and ideally expand across the UK and beyond one day.

If you agree with this mission, the best thing you can do right now is help raise awareness. Share this post wherever you think it matters – Reddit, Facebook, anywhere people might get behind the idea. And if you’re a dad in Cambridge who wants to get involved, or someone with a forward-thinking perspective who could help the group progress, there’s a link in my bio with more info.

We need to start giving dads the spaces and support they deserve.

Everywhere I look, more and more houses are being built — often on prime agricultural land that we desperately need to preserve.

What makes it worse is that these aren’t balanced communities being planned. They’re just rows of houses. No cafés, no bakeries, no restaurants, no real social spaces. It feels like soulless, basic looking houses are popping up, designed to be cheap and dense, without any thought to quality of life or the long-term loss of farmland.

Meanwhile, close to the city centre, there are plenty of old houses sitting empty, waiting to be renovated. If those were brought back into use more quickly, they’d serve the housing need far better — with existing infrastructure already in place. Shops, cafés, schools, and transport links are all right there.

On top of that, more houses on the outskirts mean more traffic and higher water consumption — both of which are already big issues in Cambridge.

Personally, I think higher-rise apartments could solve some of these problems. They use less land, have lower infrastructure costs per household, and can be integrated into areas that already have amenities. But in the UK, there still seems to be a stigma around flats, as if they’re only for “low-income housing.”, Council housing or students, on the other hand, people prefer houses 50 m2 houses with 5 m2 gardens, as if it’s something better than a 3 bedroom apartment. 
I think that mindset is holding us back from smarter urban planning.

It breaks my heart to see productive farmland being destroyed while smarter, more sustainable options sit ignored. What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/cambridge/comments/1mucsuv/dont_we_have_enough_housing_already/,mgunal,1755592606.0,2025-08-19T04:36:46,64,0

It’s a very small table, plus it’s next to the door to the loos, so not the best seat in the house, but I guess the main drawback is that it’s supposedly haunted. There’s an info sheet with the menus saying it’s haunted by an old man who will spill your drink if he doesn’t like you. I’m sure everyone would give you a quick glance at least upon discovering you’re seated at table 4…! Has anyone ever deliberately sat there or accidentally sat there, only to discover they’re at the most haunted table in one of the most haunted pubs in Cambridge? LOL.

I'd need to get a couple of quotes so need some idea of companies that will give me an idea of what would work successfully in my space without over/under selling, and who would do a reliable/tidy job of installing it (including any electrical work that might be needed) and also have capacity for servicing it in coming years.

I'd particularly like a company who might be experienced with new build flats - possibly restricted access to ceiling space, choosing where/how to install it in order to maximise likelihood of getting consent from building owner, aware of how badly flats with mainly glass walls overheat and continue to radiate heat back inside (possibly more difficult to cool than some spaces) etc.  However any recommendations are gratefully received, whether for a new build/flat or not. 

I have a small 2-room leasehold flat that is very very hot for various reasons, and a portable air conditioning machine that vents out through the window (blocked off apart from a hole for the hose). This cools the room it is in somewhat, but not always enough, and the cooling doesn't then extend to the bedroom (around a corner). It also can't be used at night (ground floor) and is somehwat noisier than ideal for working from home.  So I would like to get one or two wall mounted permanent units with an outdoor box on the patio, if I can get freeholder consent. I will need to have some slightly more detailed proposals in order to apply for consent though, hence the need for some quotes.

My main change is how I’d pattern the services. Instead of 8 half hourly services going to any manor of places south of London and then one pair barely leaving London to the north (what a waste to terminate at Kentish town), I would have 5 sets of 4 cores beyond the ‘Thameslink core’. Either side of these, the trains may terminate or spread out to different places.

The cores would be:

1. Epsom/Epsom Downs - (Sutton - St Albans):
Instead of Thameslink doing the full loop, I would have it just do the Eastern side with trains via St Helier going to London Bridge via Peckham. This would give the stations via Carshalton an exactly every 15 mins service and 4tph at all sections of the loop.

2. (Luton - Orpington):
This would give north London stops 8tph and would keep the Catford loop stops within London so people on the Bat and Ball loop instead have a faster route into London Victoria via Bromley instead of sat on this train for an hour.

3. Peterborough/Cambridge - (Hitchin - Redhill) - Reigate/Gatwick:
With all trains from Redhill going to London Bridge, the junctions around Croydon could be simplified.

4. Corby (Bedford - Luton - Croydon - Three Bridges) Horsham/Brighton:
Having Thameslink run to Corby would not only double the number of trains serving such a big town but would also make it better for opening more stations between Bedford and Corby since you wouldn’t need more terminating platforms in St Pancras or Bedford or slow down intercity trains.

5. Kings Lynn/Stamford/Bury St Edmund’s - (Stevenage - Gatwick) - Hastings/Brighton/Bognor:
I really think Thameslink should have regional express trains so that if you want to go from Brighton to Cambridge, it makes sense to sit on the same train the whole way instead of changing in London because the non stop trains terminate. I would have the stopping trains to Brighton and other places along the coast be run by southern and have Thameslink be the quicker service so that the whole routes durations on Thameslink aren’t so long. These services would also take the place of the Gatwick Express by skipping Croydon and I would have Bognor and Eastbourne have express trains into London for the first time. North of London, the end destinations would give Stamford and central Suffolk direct trains to London for the first time in decades and free up space in Kings Cross by Kings Lynn trains no Longer terminating. It also opens up more destinations for people in Cambridge who would rather wizz into London non stop.",https://i.redd.it/oy94l46zk7jf1.jpeg,slipnslurper,1755274739.0,2025-08-15T12:18:59,12,44

This free-to-attend festival of cycling around Jesus Green promises an even more spectacular event, building on the foundation of world-class sport and significant social impact delivered last year.

The route remains unchanged for 2025. A traffic-free 2.6km circuit around Jesus Green will once again transform the heart of Cambridge into a hub for residents and attendees of all ages. Elite riders will compete for one of the largest prize funds on the British scene while locals and amateurs can get involved in races and events throughout the day.

**Elevating the experience for 2025**

“We remain dedicated to our core aim: to create world-class sport and deliver social impact through a free-to-attend professional sporting event and celebration in the heart of the UK’s cycling capital,” said the **Race Director**, Owen Lake.

Thanks to continued support from local company, Majaco, the 2025 Cambridge Criterium will elevate the fan experience with exciting new additions and some favourites from last year:

**Free family ride on traffic-free roads:** Residents and fans can ride the Cambridge Criterium course on traffic-free roads before the pros from 11am to 12 noon! Sign up for free on the Cambridge Criterium website.

**Free-to-air live broadcast:** Cycling fans across the nation will be able to witness the thrill of the Cambridge Criterium from their homes, with a free-to-air live broadcast bringing all the action directly to their screens. The elite races are live from 2:25pm.

**New spectator and event village activities:** The event village on Jesus Green will be buzzing with even more excitement this year. Alongside beloved street food vendors and industry exhibition stalls, we're introducing a host of new activities and entertainment to ensure there's something for everyone, including a pump track, pedal-powered Scalextric and sprints, and a Red Bull fan zone.

Keen cyclists can even race in the Outspoken Cycles Cargo Bike Race and test their mettle on the iconic course.

**Expanded corporate hospitality:** Fans can win a pre-race ride out with Van Rysel’s sponsored athletes and exclusive finish line access for the elite races courtesy of boutique aparthotel Wilde, Cambridge City Centre. Entry is via a ballot on the Cambridge Criterium website.

**Building on the first edition**

The first edition of the Cambridge Criterium was a monumental success, welcoming **1,000 enthusiastic participants** in the free community ride and attracting a vibrant crowd of **5,000 spectators**. This overwhelming support cemented the event's place as an addition to Cambridge's sporting calendar and underscored the community's passion for cycling.

Owen says, “I was blown away by the response to the first-ever Cambridge Criterium last year. So many big events have fallen by the wayside in Cambridge over the last few years and I’m delighted that we can deliver a free community event that everyone in Cambridge can enjoy. This year is set to be even better with even more activities for people alongside watching the world-class racing.”

**How to get involved**

You can watch all the racing for free on the roadside, or you can tune in on Monument Cycling’s YouTube and social media channels, and on the big screen in the event village. 

The organisers and partners will encourage active travel to the event by providing bike parking on Jesus Green alongside fettle’s pop-up bike workshop. Alternatively, attendees can use the Park & Ride and local buses to get around Cambridge on the day with the Criterium’s Official Travel Partner, Stagecoach.

I was met with a group of maybe 15, seeming unrelated other than pairs or trios of friends, naturists hanging out by the river! 

I realised that the classic Granchester route was to keep walking to join the standard river-following path.

I was totally unaware of the naturism, and intrigued! I’ve always wanted to engage in naturism in Cambridge but couldn’t find a spot online that wasn’t a consistent club with paid meetings and such.


Is this common? Would it be okay for me to join in, if solo? Is it considered better to go midweek as to avoid the swathes of teenagers enjoying the summer holidays who are unfortunately likely to point or stare?

I’d love an answer from anyone who partakes, or was aware of this community. I was surprised to see so many nude river goers of all genders on a tuesday afternoon - no issue just intrigued.

I questioned whether buying a highly overpriced property in a booming tech city was wise, especially considering that AI could soon lead to significant job disruptions, not by outright replacing everyone, but by driving headcount reductions that could result in higher unemployment, falling demand, and eventually, a decline in house prices. 

In such a scenario, homeowners could find themselves stuck with overvalued properties and heavy mortgages.

At the time, I was met with a lot of criticism and told that I was talking nonsense.

Fast forward to today, and we can now see large buildings in Cambridge city centre sitting empty, many startups struggling to survive due to the sharp drop in VC funding, and AI-driven headcount reductions becoming a harsh reality.

I'm a **rising sophomore from China, majoring in Automation with an aspiration to become an entrepreneur.** I'm currently on an academic visit here in Cambridge, and I've just completed my first week. To be honest, things are starting to feel a bit underwhelming and boring.

My main frustration stems from the program structure. We have an English class called 'Academic Lecture' every day, which consumes our mornings and afternoons. While I appreciate the effort, I find the content to be quite basic and not particularly challenging or relevant to my academic goals. It feels more like a generic language course than an academic deep dive.

In the evenings, after dinner, it's frustrating to find that most bookstores and libraries are already closed.

**My original expectation for this visit was to truly connect with local students or people**, but I've been completely wrong on that front. For one, my limited free time is mostly in the evenings, when our teachers advise caution due to safety concerns. Secondly, there seem to be very few students around, and I honestly have no idea how to go about building connections with anyone here. The only people we really interact with are our program managers, assistants, and teachers.

**I came here hoping for a rich cultural immersion and a chance to truly experience British life, beyond just sightseeing.** Right now, it feels much more like a tour than a genuine academic/cultural exchange.

I will walk to work in the centre crossing Midsummer Common and likely be back in the evening or night.

I’m from a big and relatively safe city where I  never walked any section without seeing other people at late night (shops are open till midnight) and supermarkets are always around the corner.

I find the big span of open green space scary at night and shops are 20-30 minute walk away (I don’t cycle).

I’d love to hear what your experience about walking across the Common alone after sunset (i.e. 4pm in the winter here) and living in the area in terms of safety, convinence, etc.

I do find Cambridge generally safe but have experienced random things. I’m a young East Asian woman looking approachable so I often get approached by kids and men. Most of the time it seems to be purely out of curiosity (which is fine with me) but occasionally it’s threatening like being yelled at or having stuff thrown towards me. In Cambridge, I l’ve only lived in a college accommodation (very central) or along a main road so I’m not sure how it would feel to commute daily through two green spaces - Christ’s Piece and Midsummer Common.

Having moved from london, it's extraordinary to me how in any given 15-30 minute journey across the city, I'll come across multiple significant roadworks. Constantly shifting and unannounced road closures. Etc.

Obviously walking or cycling is better within the city and I don't generally drive just to traverse cambridge. But when driving across town to exit the other side, or to pick up a big shop or whatever, it's constant. London was nothing like this.

At least a couple of times a week, and sometimes more often, I travel to east Cambridge southbound down the A10 looking to get onto the A14 eastbound at Milton and, honestly, it's a lucky dip as to whether the road will be open or not. There are, or at least appear to be, very regular roadworks on this section of road, with no clear reason as to why this needs to be the case.

I'll go as far as to say I've never known a section of road with so many overnight closures, be that a single carriageway, dual carriageway, or motorway.

It's frustrating because every time it happens it adds at least 15 - 20 minutes onto my journey, when I'm usually tired and just want to get where I'm going, and forces me to drive through the city centre which I prefer to avoid.

I wouldn't actually mind \*at all\* if national highways, or whoever is responsible, put warning signs in advance at locations where you could turn off and take an alternative route, like Ely (although I'm rarely that far up), Stretham or Waterbeach, but they rarely (perhaps never) do - certainly aren't any this evening, and there weren't last week either - so the first thing you know is when you get onto the roundabout at Milton and see the sliproad coned off yet again.

So, does anyone know, what is it with this particular section of road that it needs so much regular work done on it, and what is the nature of the work that needs to be done so regularly?

As I say, never known any other section of road like it. I mean, it's a trunk route: can we just let it be a trunk route and stop closing it overnight all the time, please?",https://www.reddit.com/r/cambridge/comments/1mbrqzj/why_is_the_a14_eastbound_so_regularly_closed_at/,bartread,1753735285.0,2025-07-28T16:41:25,6,3

I shouted at him “Slow down!” and he just mumbled some nonsense — couldn’t even tell if it was an insult or he was just high. Next thing I know, he ditches the bike in the middle of the road (literally just leaves it there), walks a few steps to a parked car, gets inside and just sits there for a few minutes.

At this point I’m just watching and Eventually he gets out, casually hops back on the bike, and rides off like nothing happened.

No clue what that whole performance was about. Maybe just being a tw*t for attention? Or maybe something more serious going on. Either way, it’s not okay to ride like that, especially in a busy area.

Today was McDonald's: ordered two menus, an additional large fries and 20 nuggets. Fries and nuggets were missing (nuggets alone are ~7£).

Last week was Itsu: ordered around 50£ of sushi, received a completely different order for the value of 15£.

Before was pizza: 3 pizzas, one missing.

Before was McDonald's: again, missing nuggets and wrong burger.

Every. Single. Time. If I can spot it during handover I tell the driver immediately, but sometimes the bags are closed and I can't verify until I go back to the house.

Anyone else having the same experience?

We have asked for a refund so frequently that UberEats is flat out refusing, although we're not lying.

Is it common or are we unbelievably unlucky?

EDIT:
Thanks for all the replies, guys, but I think I didn't make my point clear.

Yes, I'm probably getting too many deliveries, and yes, meal prepping would save money, but my question wasn't how can I save money.

I can afford two or three take-aways a week and I like to have them. Some people smoke, some people drink, some people bet, and I don't do any of that. I just like to have a couple of take-aways a week. Nothing special: some times is McDonald's, some times is sushi. I'm lazy, and I like to treat myself like this.

My question was about UberEats, specifically: why is it so bad?

I moved many times during the past 7-8 years, and I can say UberEats in Cambridge is unacceptable. Had probably two or three wrong deliveries in my life, then I moved to Cambridge and had dozens.

A huge thanks for all the people who have already contributed!

I am a PhD researcher in Vision science, and I am recruiting participants for my second study, which aims to explore the effects of computer game training on driving reaction time. If you're interested, please register via link below.

Participants will be assigned to one of the groups and asked to play a specific game (details will be provided later). The total **game training lasts 5 hours, scheduled at 1–2 hours per week**, based on your availability. If you have a laptop or computer, the game can be installed on your device and monitored through Teams or weekly reports or the gaming can be scheduled at anglia ruskin university as well.

The testing involves responding to driving hazard clips and completing a computerized cognitive task before and after the game training, conducted at the Anglia Ruskin University lab, Cambridge, UK. While this might seem like a lengthy process, I promise it will be fun, and you can even participate with friends!

The major purpose is to develop a game-based intervention to help individuals with visual impairments overcome driving challenges. Your participation will make a meaningful impact in this, and as a token of appreciation, you’ll receive a **£20 voucher.** I wish to reward you with more amound but unfortunately this study is a **self-funded study.**I wish I could offer a higher amount, but unfortunately, this is a self-funded study.

>SIX YEARS OF BROKEN PROMISES.

>For six years, neighbors who use Hyde Park Daily have asked for the same thing: slower traffic, safer and predictable conditions for pedestrians, and infrastructure that allows buses and bikes to move through Forest Hills without incurring daily risk. Thus far, the administration has ignored requests for basic infrastructure and improved transit on a major Boston thoroughfare.

>2019 – PROMISES MADE

>The Boston Transportation Department (BTD) launches the Hyde Park Avenue Multimodal Corridor project, identifying the street as high-crash and overdue for safety improvements. Early outreach and design work culminate in a preliminary 30% plan: one travel lane each way, plus protected bike and bus priority lanes. Community response is largely positive. But momentum fades, and the project stalls before any changes hit the ground.

>2020 – MOMENTUM INTERRUPTED

>At a February open house, city officials present bold ideas: transit-priority signals, continuous bike lanes, safer crossings for one of Boston’s busiest bus corridors. But by March, COVID-19 hits. Despite having reached a significant design milestone, the City suspends all progress. The project remains frozen for nearly two years

>2022 – ANOTHER RESTART, ANOTHER PAUSE

>In spring 2022, BTD resumes community engagement. Residents echo the same concerns as 2019: unsafe crossings, high speeds, no bus or bike infrastructure. Staff recycle the 30% design and seek more feedback. By fall, the project is sidelined again — this time because BTD staff are reassigned to MBTA crisis management with the closure of the Orange Line. Hyde Park Avenue is once again deprioritized.

>2023 – FOLDED INTO A BIGGER PLAN

>In October, BTD incorporates Hyde Park Avenue into the broader Southwest Boston Transit Action Plan (SWBTAP), covering Roslindale, Hyde Park, and West Roxbury. Officials promise better coordination and renewed engagement. But throughout the year, there are no public meetings, no design updates, and no safety improvements on the corridor. Residents hear nothing; the thoroughfare worsens with traffic enforcement seemingly suspended after Covid.

>2024 – A PREVENTABLE DEATH REIGNITES THE FIGHT

>February–June 2024: BTD restarts planning quietly, showcasing materials at unrelated city events and conducting bus rider surveys. Residents attend informal office hours and view draft concepts privately, all of which include reducing the road to one lane in each direction with protected bike infrastructure. A public meeting to unveil these designs is scheduled for May — then delayed to June — then canceled entirely.

>May 2024: The Forest Hills Neighborhood Association compiles a 32-page report on deteriorating traffic and safety conditions in Forest Hills and around Hyde Park Avenue, asking for immediate action to prevent injury and death.

>October 2024: On October 12, Glenn Inghram, a beloved Hyde Park gardener, is struck and killed by an MBTA bus while crossing in a marked crosswalk near Forest Hills. Inghram’s family announces a wrongful death lawsuit. Neighbors organize: 800 residents of Forest Hills and nearby neighborhoods demand immediate fixes after five years of delays. The city responds pitifully, with tweaks to traffic signals.

>December 11: More than a hundred neighbors crowd a public meeting at the Boston Teachers Union School on a rainy night for a community outreach meeting, expecting to finally see design plans. Instead, BTD tells residents that no plans will be shared. Staff ask residents to place sticky notes on maps instead and to repeat the pain points they have been repeating for years.

>2025 – THE ADMINISTRATION ABANDONS HYDE PARK AVENUE

>January 2025: More than 700 neighbors co-sign an open letter to Mayor Wu and Chief of Streets Jascha Franklin-Hodge asking for an end to delays. The letter calls out the City’s plan to spend 2025 gathering more feedback on a project that already reached 30% design six years earlier. The authors demand action: tactical fixes now, not perfection later.

>April 12, 2025: Residents organize a “Safety Walk” along the most dangerous stretch of Hyde Park Avenue. Joined by planners and elected officials, participants highlight unsafe signal timing, missing bike infrastructure, and inconsistent crosswalks. City staff promise small changes — restriping, curb ramps, signal tweaks — to accompany planned fall repaving. 

>May 21, 2025: At the third open house in six months, BTD presents two watered-down “early action” options for fall repaving — one that would remove a traffic lane, one that would not. Neither includes protected bike lanes or meaningful transit upgrades. City officials urge residents to weigh in. They do: 365 people submit written comments calling for the safer option. After six years of delay and a preventable death, the community speaks with one voice: Do something.

>July 2025: Through intermediaries, the Wu administration signals there will be no design changes after all — just more outreach, more delay. No explanation is offered. No new timeline is given. After six years, three rounds of planning, a fatal crash, and hundreds of pleas, residents are left to ask: who exactly is the City still waiting to hear from?

A few high impact low cost ideas we could implement here as a prototype center for the rest of the city

1. Adventure park. Skateboarding, biking, cool tracks, with separate places for age/experience 

2. Graffiti wall. Get creative and let loose with paint. One section will be for endless painting, others will feature a spotlighted artist through monthly rotations. Abuse this privilege and you lose it. 

3. Snack stands. Empower young chefs in Boston to test out their recipes and skills at these stands tied into the curriculum. 

There are dozens more ideas we could implement here within a few years. Where are the fairs? The greenery? Places to sit, things that boost economic activity and joy.

Yesterday (09/05/25) at 4:09 am my bike was stolen from the utility space underneath my apartment’s back porch.  I do not always ride my bike to work so I don’t check for it every morning, so while I was at work my landlord notified me of such which was disheartening to say the least as it was a birthday gift from my parents.  The police have been notified and are looking into it but I thought it would be helpful to have help from the community as well.  The bike is a red Trek Verve 2 Low Step and as for any identifying features it has: no water bottle holder, no add-ons, a scraped right hand brake due to a drop, a white-ish smudge above the front tire, some white looking powderish residue on the handlebars from when I used to bring it upstairs in my old apartment, and it’s got reflectors on the front, back, and wheels.  I live in Dorchester, specifically off of Dot Ave and I am close to JFK/UMass, South Bay, and Columbia Road.  Attached to this post will be a stock photo of the bike and the security footage obtained from the cameras at my apartment will be viewable in the comments.  I don’t have the serial number for the bike yet but once I obtain that information I will append it to this post.  The person who stole the bike would have to be at least 5’11 as the seat is a bit high up and anyone shorter would have to lean to the side to get footing on the ground.  If anyone happens to see it/find it within the Boston area or beyond (Boston, Cambridge, Dorchester, JP, Roxbury, Malden, Chelsea, Fall River, Brockton, Dedham, Somerville, Worcester, Springfield, etc.) please let me know in the comments or send me a dm so I can alert the authorities.

2. Getting from outside 128,  I  took rt16 from Wellesley on the trip to chestnut hill reservoir. The only part of the ride where i was beeped at, and honestly impeded traffic, was over 95. It's odd because approaching that interchange there are bike lanes, then 3 lanes over the bridge with no cycling infrastructure, so i took the right most through-lane, not the lane to get on 95 north (it's uphill too so I'm pedaling like 10mph). After the bridge you can quickly get on beacon st with its own bike lane. What would you do here? I still think staking out my lane over that bridge was the right choice. There's barely an alternative route.

3. Bonus, that bike route/ carriage road that parallels Comm Ave before BC in chestnut hill is pretty nice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bikeboston/comments/1my71ky/newton_riding_today_questions/,normaleyes,1755969042.0,2025-08-23T13:10:42,6,8

Hello Everyone,

  
My bike was stolen last night from an apartment in the south end. It was left in the garden level fenced in back area and someone came in and took it. It wasnt locked as it foolishly often is back there. This is the exact bike model, just different a different bike. Mine has no back rack and instead a pouch underneath the reat seat and a hose clamp for a bike lock on the main frame. Otherwise the rest looks identical. I found my helmet ditched in a backyard down the alley in the general direction towards BMC. I filed the police report but understand the odds of it being actually recovered. Spent around 4 hours cruising around the area to see if I could spot it with no luck. Lesson learned for locking it even when it should be ""safe"". If anyone sees or hears anything it would be greatly appreciated and rewarded.

Case in point. I'm riding my ebike up the Somerville path yesterday, heading to do some shopping near Fresh Pond, and this lycra cladded boomer on a very expensive carbon fiber bike kept trying to pass me. Problem is, I'm naturally much faster than them having a motor, even without really trying, and despite the $10,000 bike, they were a bit sluggish. 

No matter what, at every intersection where I stopped for traffic, they would try and pass around me and dart out in front of cars or other cyclists. 

Finally when crossing Mass ave. They edged out into traffic to the median, and tried to beat the light so they could get out in front for good. Unfortunately for them, once the light turned green I quickly crossed the street while they were fumbling with their pedals and went on my way. 

THE INCREDIBLE TEMPER TANTRUM that this older man threw when I passed back in front of him was absolutely hilarious. It started with, ""YOU GUYS ALL PISS ME OFF, HOW DARE YOU....""

After that I decided I had enough and kicked it into high gear and left him still fumbling and ranting as I went about my way. He was still screaming long after I could tell what he was saying. 

There was no interaction, no speeding or whipping in and out of traffic, it was early afternoon so there weren't a lot of people on the path, we didn't collide or exchange words or info, they just didn't like that someone on a $1000 ebike was in front of him and his overly expensive bike and ridiculous costume. 

The lesson being, most of us just want to go on about our business and get to where we are going. However just like every other group (drivers, pedestrians, etc.), there are some people who are just miserable and want to be a nuisance. Don't be that guy, and don't judge all cyclists who you usually probably don't even notice, by the actions of people who are just going to be miserable no matter their choice of conveyance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bikeboston/comments/1mvi5sa/even_normal_cyclists_hate_the_lycra_brigade/,Terrible_Vanilla1151,1755704112.0,2025-08-20T11:35:12,26,0

The global phenomenon of “bikelash” has become one of the biggest barriers to implementing interventions that make our streets more liveable, accessible and sustainable. So how do we best manage it as advocates for change? Here are eight strategies we recently presented at the Velo-city conference.   
  
• Accept That Bikelash is Inevitable: No matter how extensive the engagement, if we're doing something consequential, an intensive minority will undoubtedly mobilise themselves against change—vested interests for whom the status quo works. We must accept that reality and find ways to work within it.   
  
• Don’t Engage with Bad Faith Arguments: For the most part, we shouldn’t spend precious time and energy engaging with bad faith arguments from people we won’t, and don’t need to, convince. Rather we should focus on articulating a positive, inclusive, liveable vision of the future to decision makers.   
  
• Share the Stories, Not the Statistics: In a post-truth society, bringing facts to a culture war is like bringing a spoon to a knife fight. We need to set aside the numbers on which we normally rely and craft narratives and messages that appeal emotionally—not intellectually—to our fellow citizens.   
  
• Build a Broad and Diverse Coalition: By sparking a values-based conversation about our societal aspirations, we can find consensus on safety, health, greening, equity, sustainability, and prosperity. This includes those left behind by car dependence, who are currently excluded from the discussion.   
  
• Engage with People on Their Terms: The current engagement process is broken; resulting in only those with the most time and resources having their voices heard. By going into the community and speaking to members at the places they happen to be, we can capture a more fair and indicative sentiment.   
  
• Locate and Support Your Champions: The process of urban transformation needs political proponents, but they'll inevitably become ""lighting rods"" for personal attacks. It is critical we prepare and protect them—helping them understand these criticisms are not representative of the larger community.   
  
• Give a Voice to the “Silent Majority”: The framing of change as controversial only leads to inertia and inaction. There is a latent demand waiting to be activated; huge numbers that will support politicians willing to push against the status quo. Our job is to ensure they are heard loud and clear.   
  
• Build a Movement That Starts with Kids: In a tricky political environment, often the most successful first step is to centre your strategy on children. Feel-good initiatives like bike buses and school streets are difficult to oppose, and get the next generation advocating for safer infrastructure.  
  
Exacerbated by a social media environment that has turned the push for liveable cities into another culture war, we shouldn't conflate the digital and real worlds. Bikelash might be inevitable, but it's surmountable, if we realise this isn't just the right thing to do, it's the popular thing to do.",https://i.redd.it/70yfwz8qk6kf1.jpeg,bostonaruban66,1755698619.0,2025-08-20T10:03:39,0,47

Then I visualized the volume of rides on each street segment using both line weight and color.

I entered it because after two years of trying to engage this administration and help out, I had no other recourse. 

The city is not acting with the urgency it must. The typical liberal seems satisfied with the performance and lip service of critical intervention. 

I have been documenting trash, traffic, and misuse of resources since I returned from college in 2023. 
I tried to officially integrate this data through employment with the city. 

spring came around and I saw both Wu and Kraft failing to propose feasible and needed policy. Then I saw the narrative framing of this race: the “good” Democrat vs the evil trump figure. 

Kraft is incapable of pushing Wu where she needs to be pushed. If you haven’t yet, watch the first mayoral forum. The media framed it as Kraft v Wu, but the substantive challenges and proposals came from me. 

Wu knows who I am. We spent two hours on a stage with 3 other people. She’s heard what I’ve been doing around the city. she’s known that I’ve been documenting the non response and dereliction of duty of her admin. 

Councilor Durkan told me that perhaps the city would be more responsive if I stopped saying I was running for Mayor. 
Given that it had ignored me and iced me out for two years before the campaigning, I doubted it would change anything. 

Since May, I reached out to Wu directly once, a week after the debate. I shared my summer Olympics plan, highlighting how it could help bolster support for white stadium while cleaning the city and building civic pride. No response


An advisor told me that I have probably been labeled a bull in a china shop. 

If Wu committed to her stance that she empowers city residents to improve their home —if she truly believed that schools, children, and leadership programs are investments in the city’s future—
she would have found ways to work with me. 

I am the result of all those investments she champions. Since the 4th grade through undergrad, I’ve received over 800k in educational and leadership training grants. 

I’ve offered dozens of avenues for collaboration. 

Not allowing me to make a return on investment is another example of mismanaged resources. We cannot afford to wait for bureaucracy to decide they’d like to start working. ",https://v.redd.it/y89fo6m45nif1,paxbike,1755027284.0,2025-08-12T15:34:44,33,209

[Example](https://imgur.com/a/q58pnCb)

In Downtown Crossing there's a big temporary electronic sign that says ""NO SCOOTERS"". I think the intent of the sign is the sit-down scooters, like vespas, but I am also literally a scooter. This morning some guy yelled at me and made a big show of taking my picture (as I was politely going 5 mph, lol)

So really I have two questions:

1. Is there another good route that keeps me in bike lanes? I'm playing around with google maps and it is firmly suggesting I go through DTX, but I guess I could try going straight through to South Station and cutting up? I'm not familiar with the bike lanes there.

2. Can I justify taking the kick scooter through DTX? I already know the answer to this because I'm literally a scooter, but I'm kind of venting here.

Before hopping on the cargo bike with ""rubber legs"" - he gets it!) and my 6 year old also managed his longest ride - 14+ miles! - on an out-and-back from Davis Square to the Seaport. 

It's amazing that you can do this route and be on dedicated, car-free paths the entire way. 

This was also our first time in the locks near the bridge - what a wonky and fun piece of infrastructure.

Anyway, as someone who has spent many, many miles biking around Minneapolis/St. Paul, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, San Diego, Denver, NYC, San Francisco, Montreal, and a few bike tours through Spain and France, and some tourist visits with day long rides around Stockholm, Amsterdam, Nice/Montpellier, I feel very confident in saying that metro Boston offers the best biking experience in the United States. The combination of geographic size/lack of expanse, year round weather (even the worst is still bikable!), path infrastructure, on road bike infrastructure, policy/laws, bike share, proportion of bikers, elected officials backing biking, etc - the Boston Metro blows every other city out of the water in the US.

Sure, a place like Boulder or Davis may have a more connected network of bike lanes - but people are still living 15 miles from work - life is still car dependent.

Today I'm inviting you to a Franklin Park Community Care Day happening over two days, August 9 and 10th. 
Please feel free to come whenever and for as long as you can, or offer support in other ways. I'll be answering questions sporadically, but provide more context below.


This event is meant to trigger a change on multiple levels when it comes to trash. The disgusting amount of litter that blankets the city is a severe indicator that we (certain progressives) are not acting fast enough, or act without enough vision and focus, to address existential crises. Not just to the city, but to our collapsing world. 

The solutions we need are not radical tech innovations that we have to endlessly service capital to find. We have to consume less. Waste less. Work, drive, and be content with materially less; with more in every other sense. 

I have proposed many ideas, but emblematic of the alternative systems I am building are the Boston Summer Games. Boston is a city of athletes. Pedestrian focused infrastructure is always packed and uncomfortable on peak days. But they are far from empty in the rain, snow, or cold. 

City wide athletic competitions: residents rep their neighborhoods in everything from soccer and volleyball to e-sports and a new Boston Marathon. The buy in would be huge and the results mutually beneficial. 

I add a litter clean up element to it. To buy entry into these games, you have to collect litter. As individuals or teams. The litter also counts to neighborhood point totals. If you go to another neighborhood and clean, the points multiply. Game of Zombie Tag in the Common for Halloween; winners of their heat win byes in their event of choice. The games expand beyond the summer and neighborhood lines. 

The trash collected will be researched, weighed, tracked to origin, and then fined to the companies until a collective solution is achieved. The annual aspect allows the research to develop trend lines and produce results. I have a thousand other tie-ins across sectors –children raising endangered insects in class, planting their food sources, and partnering with research institutes to materially change this world. . . . 

City agencies were notified about this clean up a month ago, repeatedly followed up on, and they put up a blank wall. The office of civic organizing did confirm material drop off. The Parks and Env. departments were contacted to form a plan to deal with hazards and direct the weeding process. Since they have ignored me, I have moved to tapping resident volunteers. 

I hand delivered 14 save the dates to City Hall and Kraft HQ. A week ago, I walked 4 miles collecting garbage along Mass Ave to leave 40 lbs of garbage at City Hall in a show of civil disobedience. I was quickly swarmed by cops, a response that highlights the neglect, dysfunction, and waste of city resources by current leadership. 

Here is an excerpt of my last email to these departments and city leaders: 
Here is what the event still needs: 
1. Coordinated responses from Parks and Env. Departments. 
In discussions with Civic Organizing, I expressed that we need city support to deal with sharps and hazardous materials found all over the park. I have cleaned hundreds of lbs already from the park; the broken glass is too ubiquitous for us to mass report dozens of sites across the park. 
I have suggested that the city provide marking flags for volunteers to point out the hazards to a special crew. 
These agencies should also be present as we plan to trim back invasive plants and need official caretakers to direct volunteer efforts. 


2. Water stations 
I hope that the erratic weather and intense heat of this summer makes it evident to the city why they should provide water stations to volunteers performing physical labor for the collective benefit of the city. I will be baking cookies and providing fruit as light refreshments, at personal cost. 



All city councilors were invited and repeatedly asked to set up the event. None have done so. Councilor Santana's office did get me in contact with constituent services. The call felt somewhat productive. The impact remains to be seen. One councilor asked me what I “want[ed] [them] to do about it”. Even though my emails clearly spelled out the advocacy needed and the implications for the city’s health, I once again repeated the water, hazards, and city support needs. 

 Another councilor told me their constituents get mad if they spend their time elsewhere in the city. They have to focus on their districts, so they weren’t sure if they felt comfortable with showing up, or pushing for resources. When they brought up needing to direct their energies because the position is so overwhelming, I asked them if they thought I could relate to the feeling of over-exertion, after picking up thousands of pounds while working a wage job with 0 benefits, for the good of a city that refused to hire me, a city run by people who refuse to solve the systemic issues they have the power to solve. 

Domingos Darosa has been a great help organizing the event. He has stepped in to help find volunteers, transport material, and promote the clean up. 

Michelle Wu was invited, repeatedly. I made her aware of my efforts and the structural issues I’ve documented in city bureaucracy. I joined this race so that I could have the stage, in front of an accountable audience, to make sure she heard what I was doing to improve the city without her help. I don't understand how you can campaign on having made a bureaucracy responsive to citizens in order to produce “real results” while ignoring a citizen producing those results through sheer force of will. 


If you have issues with me, the way I present myself, or my attitude, this is your chance to let me have it. If you want to expose me for being a Kraft plant, come do so! He’ll be there too so you can get to the bottom of it. 

After 2000 lbs of garbage, 60 applications to City Hall, 2 years of trying to work with/for this admin, I have made my point about weak leadership. 

Millions of dollars spent on plastering their faces all over the city. 
Thousands of volunteers mobilized to spread their name and image. 
Yet when it comes time to model democracy, civic participation, and sweat equity to show that collective action produces real results, I find only campaign signs with their faces.

(Awesome show.) I couldn’t find any good information beforehand on how to bike there, just complaints about traffic leaving and uber prices. So I figured I’d write this guide to help out others who search this.

TL;DR: As long as the train timings work, you are comfortable with a little bit of tight shoulder riding next to cars, and you are ok being in a state of mind to bike vis-a-vis substance use (no drunk concert :/ ), then go for it!

Full experience:

5:45pm: commuter rail to Providence departed South Station, packed full of drinking and rowdy concert-goers. Surprising, as I thought most people drove. Barely had space for my bike on the rack because there were so many people standing. $10 unlimited weekend commuter rail ticket was not checked.

6:37pm: Arrived 8 minutes late in Mansfield. A few had gotten off a stop at Sharon to catch an Uber outside the surge zone. The rest, probably a couple hundred, got off at Mansfield, and most walked (and missed the opener) though a few Ubered. My train car didn’t have a conductor to open its doors, so I had to awkwardly force my bike through two cars. Next time, I’ll ask the conductor where to board to make disembarking easier.

6:55pm: Arrived. Easy bike ride in if you’re mildly comfortable with streets. The last half mile near the highway is a little sketchier, but easy enough, just take it slow and cautious. After looking around for a bit, I had to ask 5 different employees where to lock my bike before getting an answer: there’s a shed in the lot, center left when facing the entrance. Outside it are some gates to which people often park their bikes. Their backup ideas were rebar in concrete barriers along the driveway, or apparently there’s a bike rack all the way back at the entrance. The shed worked. There was only one other bike, a beefy ebike, parked there (and was true when I left). Here’s the shed pinned on Google Maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/5pmstE1tKjXserNZ6

7:00pm: double-locked my bike and headed in. Had to make a couple embarrassing trips back to my bike to get through security. Long story short is they do not allow bike helmets nor drawstring bags even when thin, flimsy, and completely empty. Locked those to my bike. I was able to bring my lights and empty water bottle in.

7:15pm: After exploring the venue and filling up my bottle at a water fountain, I got to my seat in GA open air Section 9. Almost all seats were still empty. I got front row, seat 27, five seats away from Section 10. Perfect view, further towards 10 would’ve had a pole in the way.

7:30pm-8:15pm: opener.
Seats entirely filled in between.
8:35-10:51pm: Rufus. (They have to end before 11 to comply with noise ordinance.)

10:30pm: Some started leaving to avoid traffic.

10:51pm: Show ended and we left. Easy out from my spot. Had time to use the bathroom and check out the backyard for a few minutes and still make it to my bike by 11pm sharp. I rushed a little since I worried about squeezing through traffic after the reputation.

11:05pm: Departed after getting ready for a few minutes. Gobs of people walking, and lines of cars already started. I walked the bike through the crowed and was right on the main exit out, with a wide and nicely paved shoulder that was clear of cars. Even the traffic towards the highway was moving and mostly had a shoulder for me to ride in. You do need to be comfortable riding alongside a lot of cars, and have lights!!! Once past the highway overpass, which took about 4 minutes, it was extremely quiet and easy all the way to the station. Passed a few groups of people walking to the station.

11:20pm: arrived at the station, only a couple groups ahead of me. Lots more arrived before the train though. I overheard some saying they ubered for $60, but presumably a good amount left a little early and walked the 3.5 miles. Probably 75 people in total.

Riders will take a morning ferry to Hull, then bike 65 miles to a campground, set up camp, hang with new friends, and then get up the next day and bike another roughly 65 miles to Provincetown on Cape Cod. There will be on-road and off-road routes provided. Campsites and transportation to Hull are included in the $35 registration fee, with the proceeds benefiting the BCU.

This is a great trip for an introduction to bike camping for strong riders! All riders are responsible for their own navigation, gear, meals, mechanical repairs, and return transportation from Provincetown. Note that if you’d like to take a ferry from Provincetown back to Boston, the price for you and your bicycle is around $100. Most riders opt for this ferry.

Or at least some inspiration.,"Not Just Bikes is probably one of my favorite channels to share with bike infrastructure skeptics so I thought I’d share the latest video I watched. He’s great because a) I spent three years in the Netherlands before moving here a year ago so it’s sentimental for me, and more importantly, b) his take on non-car infrastructure is experience and fact based, not emotional. He acknowledges some of the downfalls and limitations. 

I really liked this video because it really highlights that cars and bikes can coexist, but also that deprioritizing cars doesn’t mean deprioritizing a specific group of residents like kids or mobility limited groups. It also emphasizes the positive impact reducing cars has on the feel and perceived liveliness of even a small sleepy town. I recognize that the Netherlands has a far more robust train system connecting neighboring towns, but Boston and surrounding towns have such potential despite this. 

All to say, next time you are chatting with your bike skeptic neighbor or uncle or (as in my case) uncomfortably politically involved landlord, I highly encourage you to share a video or two from this channel, even if just to get them thinking a tiny bit more openly and critically about non-car infrastructure.

Also known as “Dutch-style” due to its widespread adoption in the Netherlands, its key feature is football-shaped corner islands that create a forward queuing area for cyclists and pedestrians, positioning them in easy view of waiting drivers and shortening their crossing distance. These also force drivers to make sharper turns, slowing them down and making cyclists and pedestrians more visible.

>The layout offers clarity for who goes where, which is especially helpful for cyclists wanting to make left turns. They can first cross straight and then wait behind the opposite corner’s island for their left turn, all while staying on a bike path. Together, the elements of protected intersections minimize zones of conflict with cars and decrease the likelihood and severity of collisions.

This really is the missing piece of Boston area bike infrastructure and even new projects that are otherwise good still fail at intersection design.

Rail trails are, let's face it, kind of boring, but they are a change of pace and often beat the alternatives.

I was heading east on Mt Auburn and had the right of way going up to the intersection of Hawthorn. There was a bus behind me and the light was blinking yellow. I was in the lane, and the bus blew past me and went through the intersection at about 30mph, even though there were cars there before the bus (and me before the bus, because as I said I was in front of the bus and had the eastbound right of way). 

As the bus flew by me about 2 inches from my left handlebar end, the updraft started to make me wobble and I was afraid I'd fall and get crushed under the back wheels. So I tried to hop the curb to my right, but hit my front wheel and went over the bars and landed on my knees and hands, very luckily on some dirt rather than concrete. Tire slashed and front wheel destroyed. 

I'm 99% sure the driver saw me fall and they just kept going. Indeed, I'm 90% sure the driver knew they were breaking the law and being negligent when they overtook me in the same lane and blasted through the intersection at full speed. A car coming up behind the bus stopped to see if I was okay, but I was too shocked to get the bus number (i.e. not the route, but the bus itself) or ask for their info to serve as witnesses. 

I limped down to the bus depot at Brattle and talked to a dispatcher who told me to call MBTA customer service. Did that and got an incident number and the contact info to make a claim. Then went to the ER at Mt Auburn hospital to make sure nothing was broken (luckily not, though over an hour later my heart was still racing and my blood pressure high). Called MBTA police after to file a report. At first they said if I contacted MBTA customer service they didn't need to take a report, but then they called back and said they would take a report and investigate it. Now, I'm just waiting to hear more. 

I'm really, really shook up by this. I've biked in over a dozen major American, Canadian, and European cities and nothing like this has ever happened to me. What's more, I posted in this sub last year about almost being hit on Mt Auburn by a car and about a woman who almost hit me on Fresh Pond and then chased me screaming insults for like two blocks.

>This study explores a paradox: the negative relationship between mobility (motor vehicle travel) and economic productivity. Contrary to popular perceptions, more driving tends to make communities less prosperous. Conventional planning often assumes that faster, cheaper and more vehicle travel supports economic development but evidence described in this study indicates that, on the contrary, in mature economies productivity tends to decline with more driving and increases with non-auto travel. This study investigates why this occurs. It identifies six specific ways that automobile-oriented planning reduces productivity including higher user costs, increased public infrastructure and external costs, reduced non-auto mobility options, higher sprawl-related costs, reduced spending on local goods and services, and less attractive urban environments. These impacts filter through the economy, reducing overall productivity, employment, incomes, economic opportunity, property values and tax revenues. This study indicates that productivity increases with more efficient transportation, so economic activities require less driving. It identifies ways that transportation agencies, business and individuals can better achieve economic goals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bikeboston/comments/1lxzh3r/study_contrary_to_popular_perceptions_more/,Im_biking_here,1752323972.0,2025-07-12T08:39:32,2,53

The western side of the North Washington Street Bridge has ""opened"". Car traffic is up to their full lanes (including the dedicated bus lane, which is open and marked). The sidewalk is good to go. The bike lane is no longer blocked off at the entrance, though once you reach the middle of the bridge it is fenced off to store more construction material (and they didn't even put in a ramp to get you up onto the sidewalk!). For now I'll probably just take the bus lane, but the full separation was very nice. They just need to get the junk out of the middle section.

I did also feel that the bike lane dumps you in a very poor position to continue south on North Washington. You're all the way to the right of turning traffic and there's no bike box. On the plus side they also repaved North Washington between Causeway and New Chardon, which had previously been insanely bad.

I already saw 4 drivers use the bus lane to cut the line, so hopefully we get some enforcement (though there were already 4 cops sitting at the northern end of the bridge chatting with each other while this happened).",https://www.reddit.com/r/bikeboston/comments/1lunos2/north_washington_street_bridge_update/,TomBradysThrowaway,1751978898.0,2025-07-08T08:48:18,2,14

I didn't know that part of the bruce freeman, OR that part of the mass central were paved but they are. 

BUT there were a couple of issues. Theres a dead section around the sudbury river/route 20 area between the paved wayland/weston section, and the rest from sudbury on west. It isn't even cleared out, nevermind paved. I assume this is coming at some point? It was extremely sketchy riding that section on route 20 with very little shoulder and no sidewalks. 

Also are there any plans to connect the waltham and belmont ends of the mass central where it ran along the currently still active tracks? From Beaver St in Waltham to Brighton St in Belmont? The right of way is plenty wide enough for a trail, although they don't like running trails THAT close to active tracks. 

Other than that, this route was great, highly reccomended. I was on an MTB so the gravel sections didn't bother me a bit. And I had to get creative through a couple of construction zones but that should be squared away soon enough.

I researched this route for certain criteria that I prefer, so I thought I'd share in case others had the same goals:

* Over half the route (57 miles) is on dedicated bike/mixed-use paved trails.
* Since these trails are all former rail lines, they tend to be easy to follow with relatively low elevation gain.
* Added bonus of getting to casually mention that you biked to New Hampshire and back.

Google maps:
https://maps.app.goo.gl/mEdyU2XfyCnQ2kVQ6

The route:

* Pick-up the MCRT in Waltham at Middlesex Circle. Soon you'll be able to get on at Beaver St, but until the Linden st. bridge is repaired you have to detour.
* Follow MCRT to Rt 20 near where it crosses 95 (2 miles).
* Take Rt 20 to Church St where you can rejoin the MCRT. Very soon you should be able to skip most of this when they finish repairing the trail bridge over the Fitchburg line (2 miles).
* Follow MCRT to Wayland (3.5 miles). 
* Turn left and follow Pelham Island Rd to Landham Rd and turn right. This is a much nicer route than just following Rt. 20. (3.3 miles) 
* Turn left to take Boston Post Rd to the Sudbury Diamond (~1 mile) (alternately turn right and loop back past The Coolidge to get back on the MCRT-- this short segment is paved and almost finished construction but is not officially scheduled to open until next year). 
* From the Sudbury Diamond, follow the BFRT to Brook St in Acton (10 miles). 
* From Acton, take Newtown Rd -> Harwood Ave -> Bruce St -> Sandy Pond -> Central Ave, until you reach downtown Ayer (12 miles). 
* Take the Nashua River Rail Trail to its end in Nashua, NH (12 miles).

Some notes/caveats:

* The longest on-road segment is connecting from the BFRT in Acton to Ayer. Some of this stretch has marked bike lanes, but most does not. No part felt unsafe compared to normal street riding, but obviously less safe than a bike trail. This is also where most of the hills are: not a lot compared to general MA suburbs, but more than the trails. In short, typical suburban/exurban roads. 
* The BFRT from Sudbury to Concord is officially unofficially open. I.e., it is as done as it will ever be and you're allowed to use it, but at your own risk. 
* The MCRT is rapidly developing. The above route includes a number of on-road segments which you should hopefully be able skip in a few months.
* Google seems to think the whole thing has only 1500' of elevation gain, round trip, which seems optimistic. My tracker app put it at over twice that.
* The route as described is ~46.5 miles each way. Depending on where you actually start, the whole thing may be more or less than a century.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bikeboston/comments/1lm2s95/century_ride_route_from_walthambelmont_the_mcrt/,justkevin,1751052514.0,2025-06-27T15:28:34,11,25

In fact, the world’s top six cities all have populations under 3500; of the other top 20 cities, there’s a few in the hundreds-of-thousands-of-people range in the Netherlands and Belgium, but the real outlier is [Paris](https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/cities/mackinac-island-mi), 2.7 million people, at 7th place globally, and [Munich](https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/cities/munich-bayern), 1.7 million people, 19th globally. Most of the other top global cities are tiny.

Of top cities in the US that aren’t just little villages, the top “significant” entries include [Davis, CA](https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/cities/davis-ca), at 66k people, and [Berkeley, CA](https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/cities/berkeley-ca), at 120k people, both of which seems pretty comparable to Cambridge & Somerville: college towns with roughly similar populations, bikeability metrics, etc.

On Tuesday, June 24th at 1 p.m. the **Joint Committee on Transportation will have a hearing for S.2343 and H.3653 on Truck Safety Requirements.** We extend our gratitude to Senator William Brownsberger and Representatives Decker and Owens for filing these important pieces of legislation. 



**Trucks cause injury disproportionately to their use on the roads.** 

* In 2021, large trucks comprised only 4% of vehicles on roads, but caused 8% of pedestrian fatalities and 11% of bicyclist fatalities across the entire US (US Volpe Center)



**Life-saving technology exists, but vehicles in the US largely do not adopt the following innovations** (Massachusetts was the first state to require them):

* Lateral protective devices, 
* Convex mirrors, 
* Crossover mirrors, and
* Back-up cameras. 



**The current law is progressive by US standards but does not go far enough to protect vulnerable road users.**

* Only vehicles owned or contracted by the Commonwealth are required to have the safety improvements as the law currently stands. 



**The proposed law** **expands the requirements for these life-saving technologies to** any vehicle operated under a contract with, leased or purchased by: 

* municipalities, 
* utilities, 
* wireless providers or 

* quasi-public entities in the Commonwealth. 



Expanding the requirements for truck safety devices is an incredibly important step to making sure that **every truck in America is safer.** Please consider submitting your personal stories with testimony in writing or in person to show the Committee why these expansions are important. Additionally, consider expressing support for H3609, a bill filed by Representative Armini, that would allow cyclists to treat a stop sign as a yield when safe. 



For details on submitting testimony, visit this [page](https://malegislature.gov/Events/Hearings/Detail/5226) or for more information and sample email starter [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1arnRio4uJ9nBKgF0DGhos4IKLYoaYA3DGsy_Ou6czq8/edit?usp=sharing).

(Bike advocates later noted they had submitted a petition with 1,600 names.)

Worth noting that ""bike advocates"" (Cambridge Bike Safety) didn't note this later, it was shared with the council multiple times before the meeting. The reporter simply didn't do their homework and Toner lied by omission. This wasn't in the first version of the article either so it seems this addendum (that still gives a false impression) was only added after receiving criticism. 

>“We heard a couple of times tonight that this policy order was not about a delay,” vice mayor Marc McGovern said, but he quoted Zusy’s order as “allowing for a delay in rolling out Broadway bike lanes until these needs are satisfied.”

>“So what if they’re not satisfied? What if it takes 10 years to satisfy? It literally calls for a delay until these conditions are met,” McGovern said.

I am glad to see the complete bad faith and outright lies about their intentions called out so explicitly though. 

Councilor Akeem's comments are also worth repeating:

>Data suggests there’s no delay necessary, said councillor Burhan Azeem, who led the order that ended parking minimums. “We’ve added bike lanes before and done studies about the impact. We can just look at one,” he said, pointing to a 2018 review of lanes added on Cambridge Street.

>While 90 parking spots were taken away, use of the remaining spots went down by 1 percent – because 20 percent of Cantabrigians turn over every year with graduations and other life changes, Azeem said.

>As a result of the turnover, car ownership in a neighborhood changes to adapt: “If you live in a spot where it’s not easy to find a parking spot in front of your house, the person who rents that apartment or buys a house there is more likely to be someone who does not drive,” Azeem said. “We’ve seen a change as we’ve added bike lanes, like an increase in 4 percent or 5 percent of people who bike to work. That is thousands of cars that are not on our road.” 

>“There’s no easy way to make an extra 150 parking spots. If we could do that, we would have done that with all the other bike lane installations,” Azeem said. “Sometimes there are just tradeoffs and you should just be honest about them.”

However [Wilson's reprehensible comments that she ""despises"" bike advocates talking about their own safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/CambridgeMA/comments/1lde901/councillor_wilson_says_she_despises_bike_safety/) so she can more easily focus the discussion on parking, didn't receive any mention. In my opinion that is a complete dereliction of journalistic responsibility to inform the community. You know if a pro-bike councilor said they despise how people focus on parking instead of their neighbors safety it would be the headline and they'd be framed as a monster for it. Wilson however continues to be let off the hook for the most out of pocket and unacceptable comments about cyclists, so it is no wonder her comments are escalating.

>Over the past many years, ongoing concerns have been shared regarding the pedestrian/bike interface at Jamaica Pond. In response, the 3 public partners, the City of Boston, the Town of Brookline and the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) have made various changes to try to improve safety for both. For example, installing signage and painted symbols; lane markings on Perkins Street, and separated bike and pedestrian pathways along the Jamaicaway. Despite these well-intended efforts, pinch points and at times conflicts erupt between bikers and pedestrians. Safety concerns are raised in public forums like the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Association.  
  
>With growing public use around Jamaica Pond, neighborhood groups have been asked - and are asking - that these issues be addressed in a more clear and comprehensive way. Under the auspices of the coalition, Campaign for Jamaica Pond and Olmsted Park, this meeting is being convened to begin to address these issues and to develop a strategy & next steps.

I'm following up on my post from last week about the motor vehicle/bicycle collision map for Boston on [bostonscope.com](http://bostonscope.com) because I got some great feedback. In particular u/UniWheel pointed me towards the MassDOT crash data and that made me very excited about adding data that would make this app relevant to everyone in Massachusetts.

I'm excited to share that I've integrated the **Massachusetts Person-Level Crash Data** into BostonScope. This means the map now has the potential to cover the entire state. In gratitude for the engagement and feedback from this sub, I've made full historical access available for all the full maps, including this one, without any login needed:

[https://bostonscope.com/map/person\_crash\_data](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbostonscope.com%2Fmap%2Fperson_crash_data)

I really took the suggestions to heart. Based on u/UniWheel's feedback, I've worked to include many of the fields you mentioned as being useful, like ""Vehicle Actions Prior to Crash"" and ""Vulnerable User Location."" I also made the choice to focus this map on **person-level data** so when you zoom in the numbers in the clusters represent the number of people involved in crashes because people are what matter most here.

I tried to make it as comprehensive as possible so you can dig into the specifics like crash time and other details that u/Flat_Try747 was interested in.

A couple of things to note:

* There's a record limit. I've tested it with 10,000 records, and that works pretty well. Theoretically, it could go up to 100,000, but the browser and backend can start to choke on that much data.
* When you change the record limit, there isn't a loading notification right now, so please just be patient for a moment while it fetches the new data.

My goal here is to provide a robust, production-level tool that's genuinely useful, especially if it can help make biking safer by providing better data access. Your input has been incredibly valuable in shaping this, and I'm hoping this new map is even more useful for identifying patterns, understanding different types of crashes, and supporting advocacy for safer streets. I want to make it even better, so all feedback is welcome, no matter how blunt or harsh.

Thanks again for the great suggestions and discussion last time!  
I appreciate engagement from u/UniWheel, u/chalupadupacabra, u/Analog_Jaguar6840, u/Flat_Try747, u/Im_biking_here, u/noodlesallaround, and u/cden4

I would love it you could let me know what you think of the new map and features. Again, all feedback is still very welcome because I would really like to be able to update the data transformations to make this tool as useful as possible. One of the best forms of feedback would be any questions you have before you look at this new map, i.e. what questions should this tool be answer easily?

For myself, I used the tools to generate an AI summary about the causes of bicycle fatalities in Massachusetts. I know a lot of people don't like AI for legitimate reasons, but I think things like this can be useful, even though they **definitely don't replace proper statistical analyses and case studies.**

**AI Analysis Based On:**

1. **Date Range Displayed in the Top Bar:**
   * ""**4/17/2023 - 5/7/2025**""
2. **General Search:**
   * The ""General Search"" input box contains the word: ""**bicycle**""
3. **Crash Severity:**
   * The ""Crash Severity"" filter has ""**Fatal injury**"" checked.
4. **Max Injury Severity Reported:**
   * The ""Max Injury Severity Reported"" filter has ""**Fatal injury (K)**"" checked.
5. **Result: 39 Data Points**

Based on the provided Massachusetts crash data, several factors appear to contribute to bicycle fatalities:

1. **Driver Error:** A significant portion of the incidents involve drivers disregarding traffic, signals, or road markings. This suggests that driver inattention, speeding, and failure to yield the right of way are major contributing factors to cyclist deaths. In some cases, driver fatigue or falling asleep was cited as a contributing factor.
2. **Cyclist Vulnerability:** Many of the fatalities involve cyclists being struck while crossing roadways, even in marked crosswalks. This highlights the inherent vulnerability of cyclists to larger vehicles, regardless of right-of-way adherence. The data also shows that many cyclists were 'totally ejected' during crashes, which is indicative of severe injuries. Also, some cyclists were in the roadway or not visibly seen.
3. **Environmental Factors:** While some crashes occurred in daylight and clear conditions, others happened at night or in poor weather (rain). This suggests that low light conditions and wet roads increase the risk of accidents.
4. **Location and Infrastructure:** The crashes occurred at various locations, including intersections (with and without crosswalks), and non-intersections. The presence of pedestrian crossing signals in some incidents doesn't guarantee cyclist safety. While some roads have bike lanes, these aren't always present and even when present, don't completely eliminate risk.
5. **Data Limitations:** A significant limitation is the ""Unknown"" or ""Not Reported"" entries in many fields. This makes a thorough analysis challenging as some contributing factors might be underreported or impossible to determine. Comprehensive data on cyclist behavior (e.g., following traffic laws, helmet use) are also missing in multiple incidents.

**In summary:** The data strongly suggests a combination of driver inattention and unsafe driving practices, coupled with the inherent vulnerability of cyclists, and sometimes exacerbated by environmental conditions, contribute to bicycle fatalities in Massachusetts. Improvements in driver education and enforcement, better cycling infrastructure, and increased cyclist visibility (especially in low-light conditions) are potential areas for intervention. However, a more complete data set with fewer unknowns would allow for a more robust and definitive analysis.",https://bostonscope.com/map/person_crash_data,PublicDataMambo,1749877679.0,2025-06-14T01:07:59,1,13

Join Quincycles June 28th!,"Join Quincycles on Saturday June 28th for a summer marathon bike ride to visit every beach in the city, with food and refreshments to be served afterwards at Wollaston Beach.

The ride will begin in Quincy Center, and we will start tracing the coasts in starting in south at Quincy Point, and ride north into the neighborhoods of Germantown, Houghs Neck, Adams Shore, Merrymount, Wollaston Beach, Squantum, Marina Bay and finally end at the parks near the Wollaston Beach Visitors center.

Not sure if you can do a full 26 miles? No problem! Participation of the full ride is not required to participate

The ride will be split up into different routes, all of varying length so you can drop-in/drop out wherever you feel most comfortable. The meet-up/drop off points are strategically chosen near areas of parking/public bathrooms/public transit, to allow for ease of access. Restroom breaks will be planned at the end of each segment. 

This ride is sponsored and supported by Save the Harbor/Save the Bay. This event is sponsored/funded by our friends at [Save the Harbor, Save the Bay](https://www.savetheharbor.org/) check them out for more summer events that support our local and wonderful beaches and parks!

* **Cohesion:** ""A cycling network is only as strong as its weakest link""
* **Directness:** ""Cycling should be as fast and convenient as any way of getting around, if not faster... Give people the shortest, most direct route possible, with minimum detours, ideally no more than 20% longer than a straight line""
* **Safety:** ""where possible differences in speed an vehicle size are managed, when that is not feasible different types of traffic are separated"" bike routes continue through intersections

I saw a discussion in r/boston that mentioned this subreddit, and I thought this community might be interested in a map of all of the motor vehicle/bicycle collisions in Boston.

When a collision between a motor vehicle and a bicycle is reported to the police in Boston, they can log it either as a 3810, which has the description M/V ACCIDENT - INVOLVING BICYCLE - INJURY or a 3811, described as M/V ACCIDENT - INVOLVING BICYCLE - NO INJURY. The different is the first notes there was an injury and the second notes there was no injury.

I created an entirely new Map saving and sharing feature on the [bostonscope.com](http://bostonscope.com) platform so I could share this map of Motor Vehicle/Bicycle Collisions in Boston via a simple URL accessible to guest users who aren't logged in. I also created special icons to make it easy to see the injury vs. no injury incidents.

The map allows you to filter by date as well, so you can limit the time range.

I hope this is useful or of interest to this community, and maybe it will provide data that can help inform safe biking routes or support efforts to make dangerous intersections safer.

I know there are limitations to this data, because not everything is reported to the police and the circumstances around the collision are not listed, but I think can still offer insight.

It might be possible to do something similar for Cambridge since this platform has data for Cambridge as well, but it will require a little more data annotation since Cambridge doesn't code bicycle collisions as neatly as Boston does.

This is still a new web platform, so all feedback is welcome!

* ""blur of bike blew through a stop sign"" ""blowing through stop signs""
* ""apparently indifferent to the existence of traffic lights or the fragile mortality of pedestrians""
* Discussion of bike movement using fear mongering terms: ""blur of bike blew through"" ""came barreling through"" ""the kind of maneuver that belongs on TikTok under #UrbanStunts"" ""sneak up on you""
* ""now it’s the cyclists who scare me more \[than drivers\]""

And calls for the police to focus on ticketing cyclists and ""start writing citations like they’re giving out free scones at Petsi Pies"" this is despite broad community opposition to exactly this and the city council having previously told the police to knock it off. All over ""nearly"" being hit, not any actual crashes of course but that doesn't stop the author from saying ""I’d like to return home with memories — not medical bills"".... They already did.

None of the local context or the fact that cyclists Idaho stopping or using the leading pedestrian interval are proven to increase safety are mentioned. It is truly incredible to see the standards of journalism, or rather the lack there of, when it comes to anything related to cycling.

I was riding toward Davis, a little west of Lowell Street, fully in the right lane. I noticed some debris in my path, so I moved slightly to the left to dodge it, while fully remaining in the right lane.

Simultaneously, I heard a voice: “on your LEFT.”

I quickly veered right, but perhaps in response to my slight adjustment, the cyclist who had just announced their intent to pass changed their course, and attempted to pass me on the RIGHT.

They ran into me, and as I lost my balance, I reflexively reached out and grabbed their bike to stabilize myself. Thankfully, neither of us fell, and nobody was hurt. Had I been moving any faster, it could have been a different story.

Had the other cyclist not tried to quickly skirt by me along the diving yellow line, and instead moved completely into the left lane to pass, this collision wouldn’t have happened.

*On Tuesday, June 3rd at 11:00 AM, the state legislature’s Joint Committee on Transportation will hold a public hearing on automated enforcement. The bills—H.3754 and S.2344—would legalize the use of automated enforcement in Massachusetts.* 

*These critical measures are sponsored by Representatives Owens and Cruz and Senator Brownsberger.Please write to* [*Siobhan.Morrissey@mahouse.gov*](mailto:Siobhan.Morrissey@mahouse.gov) *to provide written testimony to the state committee hearing in support of automated traffic enforcement for speeding and running red lights.*

Here's my letter. I specifically did not mention that I am a biker because I unfortunately don't think we're a very sympathetic group.

\---

I am writing in favor of allowing cities and towns to use automated traffic enforcement.Simply put -- driving a car is a responsibility. Failure to obey the rules puts people's lives at risk.

In my area (Somerville, MA), I routinely see cars run red lights. These are not cars that started through on a yellow, and they're not cars that are turning right after slowing down. These are cars that are going through the light after the other direction has turned green. These are cars that decided not to wait during 4-way pedestrian crossing lights (with pedestrians actively crossing!), and just drive straight through the intersection. These are cars that are not paying attention and start driving straight when the green arrow turns on, even though the light is not green to go straight.

Police enforcement is non-existent, for whatever reason. In any case, automated enforcement is better than police enforcement: it is consistent, impartial, and has 24-h coverage.

I'm not exaggerating when I say I often feel like I am taking my own life in my hands when I get behind the wheel these days. Please allow this regulation at the local level. There may be parts of MA that do not need this, but we do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bikeboston/comments/1l1w6mm/red_light_cameras/,ithink,1748904557.0,2025-06-02T18:49:17,32,70

Only the brave and committed rode bicycles in Boston. ​I would even ride to work in the snow at times. However I took a trip to Bali 2 years ago and tried out a 125cc scooter with literally no motorcycle experience. I was hooked. I got myself a juiced hyperscorpion ebike. It went to 30mph. My commute was just a breeze. I got my motorcycle license and then rode around on the greek islands on a scooter. I later then purchased my current 500cc motorcycle. However starting out with my ebike I had some accidents such as bruises road rash and later a torn MCL. I was undeterred and got back on soon as I could. As of now I commute from roxbury to cambridge with a revv1 ebike. I use my speed and size to filter up ahead to get the jump and leave everyone even cars behind me. I just cant even fathom commuting via bicycle. I still ride my pedal bike from time to time on weekends. However when I have shit to do I just don't ride my pedal bike anymore. In many places such as southern Europe, Latin America and asia hardly anyone commutes via bicycle and rides scooters or mini motorbikes. This is my experience as a rider from boston.

I am looking for help, advice and insight. This is the first time I've gotten hit bad enough that it damaged my bike and body.

Su 5/25 \~3pm I was on Market St in Brighton headed northbound (towards Watertown) in the bike lane. There was a car coming from the opposite direction that turned left onto a small side street - Gardena St - and it hit me. I saw the car headed towards me and swerved hard right as I yelled as loud as I could but the driver must really not have been paying attention and still caught me in the crosswalk, a few feet away from the bike lane. She hit my left side hard enough to bend my left crankarm so much that it collides with the chainstay and totally bent my front wheel. I flopped against the pavement after that, bike doing a 180 and I slid along the pavement a good ways.

I just got the police report, and it seems all jacked up. It says I collided with the car. Not even the driver claimed this. I am surprised because the cop seemed at the scene to understand that I had the right of way and said this to the driver. The driver and her passenger were contesting that it was their fault, they kept saying I turned in front of them, like I was turning right on Gardena, and they defended themselves aggressively \[in retrospect, even if I was turning right on Gardena I would still have the right of way, but the fact was I was headed straight\]. I think that what happened is they were completely unaware of me until they saw me in front of them (they are in their 70s). I told the cop that I swerved because I saw no other option, that braking would have just left me in the path of the vehicle. In the report it says:

>Moreover, Mr. Martin stated that while he was traveling down Market Street heading towards Guest Street on his bicycle, he saw Ms. Zeggarra's vehicle, but it was too late for him to avoid her. Mr. Martin stated that he took a right turn on to Gardena Street attempting to avoid the vehicle but then took a left in front of the vehicle thinking that he had enough time to avoid the vehicle, but it resulted in him colliding with the car.

This sounds like complete horseshit to me. I ""turned left in front of the vehicle""?? This report has no insurance information for the driver, but everyone I spoke to about it, staff at the bike shop and at Brigham ER where I went later that evening all said the insurance info would be on the police report, like it's expected. The report form does not even have a blank space for insurance info. The driver did give me her phone #, but if I call her and ask for insurance information I expect her to refuse to give it. At the scene, I politely asked her to pay for the damage to my bike and her response was, ""Are you going to pay for my car?"" I am thinking the cop used the wrong report form. If you look at the options on the report they are all for theft or violent crime. I've tried reaching out to the supervisor named on the report, called the BPD Brighton Station and whoever answered referred to someone else for whom I only got voicemail (but no response yet).

Is it important for me to get the report corrected? How do I find the driver's insurance info if she refuses to give it? Do I need an attorney? Can anyone recommend an attorney?

Even with a helmet on, I did take a big impact to the right side of my head when I hit the pavement and with that and the adrenalin I did not feel any pain at the time but I did feel a little loopy, dizzy and hazy, even though I never lost consciousness and was able to think and talk. I remember specifically having a lot of trouble getting the back wheel back on my bike, something that would not normally be difficult to do, after I had removed it while trying to fit in the back of the cop's SUV when he offered to give me a ride home. The front wheel was not quick release and no one nearby had a hex key so we had to give up on that. I ended up getting the bike on the 86 bus to Harvard Sq and red line to the bike shop near me.

As for bodily injuries, I was able to get up and walk right after the accident, and I did get checked out at the scene by an EMS that the cop called. I have swelling near my right eye, pain and small road rash on my left face. Road rash on right elbow is what most people at the scene remarked about but it's actually not as bad as some the other stuff. Swelling and pain on the inside of my right forearm just below the wrist appeared later that evening. A big bruise on the inside of my right knee appeared the next day - I think this might have been bike frame knocked against it when the car hit or at the fall to pavement. Pain and redness on the top of my right foot bad enough to get an xray but it seems they don't think its a fracture, maybe a muscle cramp?? - it's still there but it is getting better slightly. The thing that is maybe bothering me the most right now is my right shoulder feeling out of whack - I am popping the joint a lot and the deltoid muscles are extremely tight almost cramped this whole time (now 3 days later) even though I have taken prescribed muscle relaxers.

Lastly, the Trek bike shop on Alewife Brook Pkwy, who have been my shop for a while now (even though my bike is a Cannondale) are saying they want to just quote me for a new bike. My bike is an aluminum alloy frame and does not seem to be damaged. I'd say I need a new front wheel, new seat and new front crank assembly (to fix left crank arm and bent gear teeth). They talk about the dangers of possible frame damage in a way that as I research it doesn't seem to apply to alloy frames, but to carbon fiber. I love that bike and would be happy keeping it, don't care if I get insurance to pay for it, just want to get it working again. Does anybody have any insight on unseen damage to alloy frames and possible risks? Is the bike shop just trying to make a sale?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kxpkl3,DerHunMar,1748459248.0,2025-05-28T15:07:28,51,56

* Ban Right on Red in Boston: 
   * Cities that prioritize the safety of pedestrians reduce conflicts in intersections. Impatient drivers glancing only for oncoming traffic, and not children, slower crossing elders, and people on bikes risk all of our lives and limit mobility. [Cambridge recently banned right on red](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/10/nx-s1-4928000/more-cities-are-banning-right-turns-on-red-in-response-to-rising-pedestrian-deaths), following a national trend. It’s time for Boston to follow suit. 
* Police Report Improvements:
   * Police reports are often repeated verbatim by the media, perpetuating passive voice and “accident” focused language. By [making police crash reports more fact based](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198222001294), that will influence press reporting. These reports will inform the public more accurately, identifying drivers and not cars as the agent responsible for crashes, and not using value based language such as “accident” which implies inevitability.
* Transparency and community involvement of investigations into all fatal crashes in Boston:
   * Strong Towns has provided a framework called “[Crash Analysis Studio](https://www.strongtowns.org/crashstudio)”, which can inform our approach to analyzing and preventing crashes.  The goals should be as follows:

It frames street safety improvements as essential for public health:

>Despite their value, walking and cycling remain under-prioritized in policy and planning. Globally, infrastructure is inadequate – only 0.2% of reported road length includes cycling lanes, and the majority of roads are unsafe for pedestrians. Vulnerable groups, including women, children, older adults, and those with disabilities, are disproportionately affected by poor infrastructure and unsafe streets.

>Global goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity, and the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety call for urgent, coordinated action to promote walking and cycling as part of healthy, sustainable, and equitable transport systems.

It includes seven policy recommendations:

1. Integrate walking and cycling into all relevant policiesEmbed walking and cycling objectives across transport, health, environment, education, and tourism policies. Establish clear, measurable targets and cross- government coordination mechanisms.
2. Provide safe and connected walking and cycling networksDevelop well-connected, well-maintained infrastructure that links homes to key destinations (e.g. schools, transit, workplaces). Integrate green spaces and apply inclusive and sustainable urban design principles.
3. Design inclusive and safe streets for allUse human-centred design principles to create streets that accommodate all users, including pedestrians and cyclists of all ages and abilities. Implement safe system approach to improve road safety including best practice legislation to reduce speed limits where necessary.
4. Improve safe road user behaviourEnforce speed limits, tackle distracted and impaired driving, and promote safe use by all road users.
5. Protect and prioritize walking and cyclingCreate, maintain and protect allocation of road space to walking and cycling, implement pedestrian zones, and enforce parking regulations.
6. Facilitate integrated transport optionsEnsure walking and cycling are part of a seamless transport experience through integration with public transport and shared mobility services.
7. Promote and incentivize walking and cyclingCreate a culture of walking and cycling through communication campaigns, events, financial incentives, and workplace and school programmes.

What I liked the most about this ride was to visit towns and natural places that i wouldn't visit otherwise, since there's little to no bike-safe paths but mostly routes to ride along cars going super fast. Of course also the beers afterwards were also very much enjoyed!

I'll probably be riding 20-40 miles on 4-6 mornings of the week. 

How and where do you ride your training rides? My experience riding from JP or Mission Hill has been at least 30 minutes of riding in crappy bike lanes, hitting tons of traffic lights, on relatively high-speed roads before reaching any remotely pleasant roads where I can focus on cycling and not death by vehicle. Do I suck it up and start my workouts 10 miles into my ride? Am I being soft, and should just do my scheduled workout under these circumstances? I'm considering riding the commuter rail out of town a few stops and starting my rides there -- the trains back into town, though, would be pretty full and would technically prohibit bikes.

I decided to take the plunge since I wanted to learn the area and honestly not too proud of my biking abilities yet.

My review: It was pretty great.

The guy was Gerardo, Apparently they call him big G over there.

He is a retired man from Lynn and he brought home made italian pastries to share.

Our group yesterday was literally just us(me, friend and tour guide) and we paid $75 for both of us. 

We biked for about 1.5 hours and took water breaks whenever I required them and he gave us stories about people riding there and stories about Lynn itself.

He gave me tons of tips on my riding and let me control the level of stuff we wanted to do. He showed us some of the sites in the woods and explain them.

Seems like this is not really his main business just something he is doing for fun and charging so people show up.

If anyone used this route in the last few months, you may have noticed that the small stretch of bike lane along Eversource was gutted to build underground pipelines.

I just get a response saying they are aware of it and are looking into it and close the ticket without actually resolving them. 

On top of not being paved, they moved the concrete barriers half way into the bike lane. At this point, there is only one bike lane. 

They recently repaved this whole segment again after the rains and guess what....left the bike lane unpaved and moved the barriers further into the bike lanes than before.

For proxies the locations would be Formaggio Kitchen to Boston Landing. I see a few decent options:

1. Cambridge-Watertown Greenway, make my way to the Arsenal Bridge one way or another, cross over that intersection. Could go Western -> Everett at that point, or could take a right onto the Leo Birmingham Parkway. A few issues with this one are that the intersection after the Arsenal Bridge is pretty horrible on a bike, and so is riding on the Birmingham Parkway. But this would make the first large portion of the ride very pleasant on the greenway. 

2. Head towards Harvard Square, take North Harvard st to Western, then turn onto Everett and go from there. This seems fine, North Harvard is okay, Western is okay, but it would generally be a more head-on-a-swivel commute than spending some time on the Greenway in option 1. 

3. Head towards Harvard Square but cross over near the Elliot Bridge and get on the river by Herter Park. Then take the overpass over Storrow there and do a quick left onto Western, right onto Everett.

>[Alternative 2](https://www.brooklinema.gov/DocumentCenter/View/57082/Chestnut-Hill-Ave---ALT2?bidId=) and [Alternative 3](https://www.brooklinema.gov/DocumentCenter/View/57083/Chestnut-Hill-Ave---ALT3?bidId=): Intermittent barrier-protected bike lanes along most of one side of the street and parking and unprotected bike lanes along the other side, with pedestrian improvements.

>[Alternative 4](https://www.brooklinema.gov/DocumentCenter/View/54245/Chestnut-Hill-Ave-Draft-Pavement-Marking-Plan): Barrier-protected bike lanes along most of the length, with pedestrian improvements but no parking.

>Alternatives 1, 2 and 3 do not provide safe infrastructure for bicycling on a street such as Chestnut Hill Avenue. However we believe alternatives 2 and 3 have the possibility of being modified to create a narrow barrier-protected bike lane along one side of the road and a parking-protected bike lane along the other side of the road. This could be done while keeping the motor vehicle parking shown in the current versions of these two alternatives.  We urge you to sign the Biking Brookline [petition](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSYtoo3X-HTrk3s51bMfwfcK-a9rUBiQfXpzb2HV4KZXzhPg/viewform?usp=dialog) asking the Town to create protected bike lanes on both sides of Chestnut Hill Avenue from Beacon Street to Boylston Street, which could be achieved either by:

>Modifying Alternatives 2 or 3 to provide safe protected bike lanes along the full length of the corridor;

>Adopting Alternative 4 as the preferred design; or

>Adopting some combination of all three, with modifications.

DC-area resident here who will be visiting Boston for the first time with our family in late June. One thing we love to do when visiting new cities is to rent bikes (if we can't bring our own) and do some type of ride in that city. 
  
Curious what kind of ride this group would recommend on a trail or bike-friendly route for us. We have an 11-year-old who is pretty comfortable riding longer distances and an 8-year-old who can ride ~10-15 miles depending on hills.  
  
Are there any bike shops or locations that rent out cargo bikes in the area?

* A bicycle and pedestrian crossing of the Fitchburg MBTA commuter rail line in north Cambridge
   * This project involves the planning and final design of a bicycle and pedestrian crossing of the high speed commuter rail tracks separating Cambridge’s densest public housing areas with Cambridge’s largest park and open space. The project seeks to design a direct, grade-separated bridge crossing and accompanying multi-use path connecting to affordable housing properties and the Alewife MBTA rapid transit station.
   * Federal Funds Awarded: $2,400,000
* I-90 Allston Multimodal Project
   * The section of the I-90 Interchange west of the Charles River will be realigned to the south, providing a straighter highway alignment and removing a left-hand exit. An urban-style, split diamond interchange will replace ramps, and an east-west collector-distributor with roadways/ramps will transition to a series of new north-south urban streets and signalized intersections. The Project will add 4.5 acres of park land and provide extensive bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure that prioritizes safety. West Station will be constructed at the site of a former railyard and will offer four station tracks, three platforms and a new transitway and a project Phase II will incorporate rail yard layover.
   * Federal Funds Awarded: $335,374,775
* River Works Reimagined
   * The River Works Reimagined project will develop a plan for a new MBTA River Works Commuter Rail Station, which would facilitate connections over the existing railway, provide commuter rail access to West Lynn, improve the climate resilience of our railroad, and maximize the community benefits of nearby development opportunities. The deliverable will be a comprehensive plan for a relocated station, taking into account community and transit needs as well as physical, operational and regulatory requirements. The plan and associated report will provide the analysis and documentation to initiate the funding, design, and construction phases.
   * Federal Funds Awarded$561,000
* Greening Chelsea Creek Waterfront
   * Water frames the identities of our two cities. As urban communities positioned along the northern shore of Boston Harbor, we face unique challenges in our work to fully integrate with, and remain accessible to, the broader region, most notably connecting our residents to each other, open spaces, supermarkets, and employment, education, and health care hubs. In its current form, the Chelsea Street Bridge, which spans the Chelsea Creek, divides our neighborhoods and their residents, preventing safe, comfortable access and movement for people of all ages and abilities who walk or bike. We aspire to raise the bar for our region by creating resilient and family-friendly transportation networks that support the safe and comfortable movement of all residents, workers, and visitors.

They are not posted online yet but here they are: 

https://preview.redd.it/6nctk88efzve1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5a8f09f08507ce686aed59870fe86cf9139acd0

This design is terrible: 

* It adds multiple slip lanes, reducing safety for pedestrians and cyclists to prioritize vehicular speed and throughput
* It widens the central cross section of roadway compared to the previous design (at least 1 lane throughout and 3 lanes more at the western intersection) worsening urban heat island, runoff, and safety to prioritize vehicular speed and throughput
* It widens every intersection (including on streets where DCR is currently working on road diets) with similar impacts to prioritize vehicular speed and throughput
* It does not provide pedestrian and cyclist priority at crossings forcing up to 6 separate stages for crossings where the previous design had at most 2 
   * From the SW corner of Parsons and N beacon to the Dudley White path it goes from a 1 stage direct crossing in the previous design (which is entirely eliminated in this one) to a 6 stage crossing around the entirety of the intersection
   * From the meeting the signal timings are also planned to optimize vehicular capacity not pedestrian and cycling access, forcing people to wait multiple times to cross. 
   * Again this is prioritizing vehicular speed and throughput over safety and accessibility, especially for people outside of cars.
* It does nothing to improve pedestrian or cycling routes over N Beacon bridge or across the highway to the south
* It seems to have forgotten that DCR is planning a road diet on SFR (widening it instead).

I felt like this was the worst week I can remember in a long time for getting honked at in ridiculous ways.   Generally people trying to go 45mph in a 25mph, not blocked by me at all, they had plenty of room to go cross a double yellow in did.   One was very egregious because they went right through a speed trap and I could see the police officer holding the radar gun as I biked by.   I almost stopped to ask why on earth that wasn't worth a talk with the driver.

This all culminated in getting honked at by 4-5 cars all at once and one of them being a pickup truck mouth breather who also yelled a homophobic slur on the way by.  Not that it matters but I was in street clothes, not spandex which was historically what set these guys off.   Way back in the day this used to be a thing.   But I literally don't think I've heard that in 20+ years in Massachusetts.   The cars love to speed there because the road is very wide, but it's futile due to cars backing up at lights, if you look at a 1 mile section they can't average 10mph, so even if they try to go 60mph between the lights (they do) a cyclist still ends up going through faster.  The fact someone is willing to start screaming that stuff out the windows around here again just made me think something is different.  It definitely bothered me, the whole thing was just so far out of the norm for this area.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bikeboston/comments/1k26vdb/driver_harassment_ticking_up/,bb9977,1744988063.0,2025-04-18T10:54:23,22,34

They can also frequently go in without eliminating any parking, reducing potential opposition.

One of Peter Furth's students analyzed this several years ago and demonstrates this could massively increase the accessibility and utility of the bike network: [https://peterfurth.sites.northeastern.edu/2020/05/15/contraflow-bicycling-has-a-large-positive-impact-on-greater-bostons-bicycle-network-connectivity/](https://peterfurth.sites.northeastern.edu/2020/05/15/contraflow-bicycling-has-a-large-positive-impact-on-greater-bostons-bicycle-network-connectivity/)

He identified critical streets for contraflow as:

>In Somerville: Calvin St, Harvard St, and Hudson St

>In Brookline: Ivy St, Essex St, and Lenox St

>In Fenway-Kenmore: Miner St, Van Ness St, Jersey St, and Leon Street

>In Cambridge: Allston St, and Hancock St \[He accidentally flipped Fenway and Cambridge in his list\]

>In Roxbury: Oakland St, Dale St, Clifford St, and Julian St

>In Jamaica Plain: Carolina Ave and Custer St

>In West Roxbury:  South Fairview St

>In Dorchester:  Hamilton St and Draper St.  
(The first two Brookline streets listed already have legal contraflow, but are shown to emphasize their importance.)

The recent city of Boston evaluation of bike lanes installed last year found the largest increases in cycling on streets with contraflow lanes: [https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2025/04/2024-1024%20Better%20Bike%20Lanes%20Year%20One%20Evaluation\_web.pdf](https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2025/04/2024-1024%20Better%20Bike%20Lanes%20Year%20One%20Evaluation_web.pdf)

Cities around the world - Barcelona, Paris, Singapore, and Bogota - have adopted this concept for sustainability and to improve general quality of life. As this concept gains popularity, we explore how our cities might leverage this global movement.  
  
For decades, urban planning in the United States has advanced and prioritized automobile use, which led to the destruction and splintering of Black and brown neighborhoods. What resulted was the unprecedented surge of suburbia, which designated for generations of Americans separate spaces for living, working, etc. Now more than ever, the US is confronted with a physical and political landscape demonstrating the importance of connection and community.  
  
In this talk, Carlos Moreno and Jim Aloisi explore the principles of the 15-Minute City, how it works, and how urban planning impacts our way of life and shapes how we live and move in our communities.  
  
Christian MilNeil, editor-in-chief at StreetsblogMASS moderates the discussion.  
  
Carlos Moreno is a Franco-Colombian urban planner and professor at the IAE Paris Sorbonne, University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne. Carlos pioneered the award-winning concept of the “15-Minute City” which has since become a global movement for city transformation.   
  
Jim Aloisi is a lecturer on Urban Transportation Planning and Policy at MIT, and a former Transportation Secretary of Massachusetts.   
  
Christian MilNeil has been the editor-in-chief of StreetsblogMASS since its launch in 2019, and was previously a data reporter for the Portland Press Herald in Maine.

With $3.5 million that the Massachusetts Department of Transportation secured through the Federal Railroad Administration, state officials say Massachusetts will now be able to take “an essential step in expanding and enhancing train service” between Boston and Albany, New York, with connections in Springfield.

The outlay through the FRA’s Corridor Identification and Development Program (Corridor ID) will help pay for a Boston-Albany Corridor Service Development Plan, a document that will outline the planned implementation of the service expansion including an operating plan and comparative analysis of viable alternatives. The state said the document “will demonstrate the feasibility of a Boston to Albany intercity passenger rail route, and it will detail the necessary steps to implement the service.”

The East-West Rail project has long been discussed on Beacon Hill. The state has secured preliminary federal funding for the effort, including $108 million for corridor infrastructure projects and another $37 million to design track, signal and infrastructure improvements at Springfield Union Station.

“We are full steam ahead on building West-East Rail, and this latest federal funding win brings us one step closer to delivering this for Massachusetts,” Gov. Maura Healey said. “I’m grateful for the hard work of our MassDOT team to secure this funding. Together, we’re going to expand rail service across the state to improve commutes, reduce congestion and usher in new housing and economic development opportunities.”


The state said the service development plan will “identify the purpose and need for the service, include a comparative analysis of viable alternatives, define the recommended capital projects to enable the service, and evaluate the operational, network, and financial impacts of the service and infrastructure investment.”

>Four-plus years and two state panels later, the public is finally getting a slate of options to consider for a new Massachusetts flag and seal, moving the state closer to replacing a controversial symbol whose roots stretch back nearly 400 years.

>The Massachusetts Seal, Flag, and Motto Advisory Commission on Thursday released three designs for a new flag and three for a new seal it culled from more than 1,100 submissions as its “top selections.” It also released three proposals for a new state motto.


>The flag and seal options feature various elements, including turkey feathers, an image of a whale or mayflower, and pictures of waves or water, among others. The top motto options include the phrases: “Many voices, One Commonwealth,” “We honor all life guided by the First Light,” and “We rejoice in the public good.”


>The state’s current 19th-century emblem, which also sits on the state flag, depicts a colonist’s arm holding a sword above the image of a Native American, and is draped by a Latin motto that roughly translates to: “By the sword we seek peace, but peace only under liberty.”


>The proposals put forth Thursday — which scored the highest during the 10-person panel’s last round of internal scoring — are not exactly finalists from which one final recommendation will emerge. Rather, officials said they’ll take public feedback during a slate of hearings planned for September and October, and afterward, potentially rework the designs.


>The panel has also tapped the Concord-based firm Eastern Research Group, or ERG, to help craft the designs for its final recommendations, which are due in December.


>The release of Thursday’s designs nonetheless marks a significant step in what’s been a years-long, and often divisive, process for overhauling the seal that is splashed across Massachusetts state buildings, state letterhead, and the state flag, and has long drawn objections from the state’s Indigenous population.

>“These are ideas to inspire the direction” of the final choice, Kate Fox, executive director of the Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism and the commission’s co-chair, said of the options during Thursday’s meeting. ERG, she said, will help the panel “take all the feedback and turn it into potential new emblems for the state.”


>The current state seal was designed by illustrator Edmund Garrett in 1898, and draws on the original seal of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which featured a Native American man, naked but for some shrubbery about his groin, saying, “Come over and help us,” the Globe has reported.


>Finding a replacement has been no easy task. Critics have long said that the placement of a broadsword above the Native American figure is racist imagery and symbolizes the violence inflicted on Native American populations. Still others warn against eliminating Massachusetts’ Indigenous communities from the seal entirely.


>The current commission is also the second such panel to tackle ideas for a new flag. The first iteration, created in 2021, voted the following year to recommend replacing the state’s motto and seal, but it disbanded in 2023 without offering specific substitutes for either.


>That panel instead provided a variety of suggestions for what a new seal and motto should include, including different flora such as an elm tree or cranberries, a chickadee or cod, or geographic features, including the ocean, coastline, or simply the state’s shape.


>“Appropriate” terms for the motto, the group wrote, could be “hope,” “for the common good,” or names of Massachusetts tribal nations.


>The original commission wrote that its members were split on whether a Native American figure should be included at all, with some Indigenous members saying the visual representation could “prevent additional erasure of their communities.” Others, meanwhile, argued that the depiction of any human figure, regardless of their background, could be “inherently exclusive.”


>The current advisory commission opted to solicit submissions from the public. By the end of June, it reported receiving submissions for about 1,000 flags, 300 seals, and 400 mottos. It then advanced 23 seals, 48 flags, and 32 motto designs to a second round of scoring, further winnowing those choices to the nine options it released Thursday.


>Several members of the current commission indicated they want to consider further changes to those, too.


>Elizabeth Solomon, treasurer of the Massachusetts Tribe at Ponkapoag and a member of the panel, warned that for the commission “to move from something that basically the Indigenous community found offensive to something that completely ignores the Indigenous community is incredibly problematic.”


>“I really do feel like it would be both a mistake and actually disrespectful not to incorporate something from the local Indigenous community in the new flag or the seal,” she said.


>Others also cautioned against embracing an image of a mayflower, which Rhonda Anderson, another panel member, said “can be harmful towards [the] Indigenous community.” The Mayflower, the first flag commission noted in its final report, is a symbol of the colonial era and the Pilgrims, who forced the displacement of Indigenous people.


>The options released Thursday mark only the next step in the process. The commission is required to hold at least three public hearings across the state to gather input before selecting a final design for a new seal, a new flag, and a new motto to submit with its final recommendations.


>Panel members said they intend to hold six such hearings in September and October — four in-person hearings and two virtual. Officials expect to release a final schedule in the coming weeks.


>After the panel submits its report, the governor then must submit legislation “to amend relevant sections of the General Laws to codify the new state motto and designs for the seal and flag,” according to language the Legislature passed last year.


>The Legislature ultimately would then have to approve any changes.

Well three of them were little kids and the other two were parents so I didn't feel like shoving my way through them like I usually do after saying excuse me and they don't move. I decided to walk in the very far left corner of the bike lane for 30 seconds until some prick practically slams his bike into me and says ""what's going on buddy? Just walking in the bike lane like it's your personal sidewalk?"" I apologized he flipped me off and then I told him to go fuck himself for for daring to basically hug the sidewalk on his precious bike lane where he had plenty of time and room to go around. I'm expecting good feedback from this cuz I'm not your typical redditor much let alone I'm a Boston / Cambridge redditor. And I'm not one of those car guys I take the T and walk everywhere. And not to mention in the minutes before this happens I saw plenty of people on bikes not even using bike Lanes weaving through pedestrian traffic on the sidewalk. The funny thing is I am pro bike lane. It's just that so many of you are insufferable about it and sours a lot of people's attitudes about this ""more bike Lanes now!!!!!!"" attitudes from the vast majority of Bostonians who keep their views to themselves. So who was wrong in this situation? Genuinely curious. Not trying to start anything at all.

>By creating sweeping restrictions that limit the type and extent of surfacing that can be used in Open Space Districts, the Petition would have substantial impacts on the City’s ability to plan and program Open Space. The Petitioners cite urban heat impacts as a consideration, which is an important factor that informs the City’s open space planning. However, the Petition would also **prohibit or severely restrict** the following uses:

>\* **Play courts** such as basketball and tennis, including accessible play areas designed for people with disabilities

>\* **Accessible pathways** that accommodate active movement such as bicycling, running and walking

>\* **Accessible plazas and seating areas** that often require paved surfaces

>\* **Active and passive recreation** that uses permeable paving materials such as stone dust, like Fresh Pond Reservation

>In addition to these potential planning conflicts, the approach of defining and regulating any type of paved area as a principal land use is an unprecedented application of zoning in Cambridge. One likely effect is that City attempts to plan or program open space for activities such as those listed above would require a use variance from the BZA, which, even if granted, would be vulnerable to appeal. **There are also likely to be unexpected consequences** to classifying all paved surfaces more than 10’ wide as a principal land use, which diverges from the typical understanding of what constitutes a principal land use. “Paved ways more than 10’ wide” would exist on many lots throughout the city that are characterized by other principal land uses.

>As a result of these two issues, a major concern with the Petition if adopted is that it would weaken any planning process conducted to establish goals, consider tradeoffs, and make decisions about the use of a public space in favor of a process adjudicated by the Board of Zoning Appeal and potentially the Massachusetts Land Court or Superior Court. **Due to the nature of zoning processes, this would likely elevate the influence of abutting property owners, who have standing to appeal land use decisions, over the interests of the broader public that uses the park or open space.** It could also result in **extensive delays** implementing improvements due to additional permitting and legal processes.

[https://www.caitlinforcambridge.com/](https://www.caitlinforcambridge.com/)

On her website she writes: ""Not only was I a **classroom teacher** and an **administrator**, **I now** **build schools and advise** on how to make real advances in education....Cambridge Public School, Lynn Public Schools, Boston Public Schools, Brookline Public Schools..."" - but she's never been an employee (teacher or administrator) at any of these Districts. She's never held a license in MA (or any other state, that I can find) - even though you would need to have done so, to work as a teacher or admin in any public system. (The only full time teaching position I can find is a temporary adjunct position at a now defund for profit college in NYC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe\_Institute\_of\_Technology)

At the urging of **Chair Councillor Patty Nolan,** the Health & Environment Committee of the Cambridge City Council **voted unanimously** to push forward Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) legislation. The new legislation will soon go to City Council for a final vote.

https://preview.redd.it/6bqn2oz4izpf1.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9f6046bbc16865a5c2271ccfa78f2410bc56e2a

Thank you to the Health & Environment Committee’s **Chair Patty Nolan, Councillors Wilson, Siddiqui, Azeem, and Sobrinho-Wheeler** for pushing forward legislation to end sewage pollution. Thank you also to **Vice Mayor McGovern** and **Councillor Zuzy** for their participation and support.  

Thank you to **Emily Norton** and **Julie Wood** from Charles River Watershed Association. Thank you to **Patrick Herron** from Mystic River Watershed Association.

Thank you especially to Cambridge’s excellent **City Engineer Jim Wilcox**, who shares his 15 years of deep knowledge of combined sewer projects in the city.

# Here’s what the legislation will do, if passed by the City Council:

**It asks the City Manager to…**

* Work with the newly formed Coalition to End Sewage Pollution.
* Create a Combined Sewer Overflow Commission.
* Provide a cost-benefit analysis of a 25-year level of CSO control.
* Improve stormwater regulations.
* Include green stormwater infrastructure.
* Improve public outreach regarding sewer infrastructure planning.

# Why is this important?

The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority has **not** taken seriously feedback from watershed advocates. Despite enormous public outcry, the MWRA refuses to include feedback from the public in their sewage pollution plans. The amount of sewage that is dumped into Alewife Brook is illegal and MWRA knows it. But MWRA wants to continue using Alewife Brook as an open sewer, despite having the financial ability to fix the problem. 

The collaborative planning process between Cambridge, Somerville, and MWRA is ongoing. This local legislation is separate from that effort. It creates another avenue for Cambridge to create it’s own a path towards community health by ending sewage pollution.

# What’s next?

**1.** MWRA, Cambridge, & Somerville will host their big public Sewage Pollution Planning Meeting on 9/25. This is the last public meeting that they will hold before submitting their sewage pollution plans to EPA and MassDEP.

**2.** We expect Cambridge City Council to deliberate on the newly proposed legislation. The vote from the Health & Environment Committee will happen as early as September 29th.

# The Presentations.

You can watch the video of the Committee’s hearing [**here**](https://cambridgema.granicus.com/player/clip/1069?view_id=1&redirect=true) on Combined Sewer Overflows from September 9th, 2025. 

The Committee listened to a presentation from **City Engineer Jim Wilcox**. **Emily Norton** and **Julie Wood** from the Charles River Watershed Association had an awesome presentation. **Patrick Herron** from Mystic River Watershed Association was amazing! **Kristin Anderson** & **Eppa Rixey** from Save the Alewife Brook presented last.

**City Engineer Jim Wilcox** said, “The crown jewel of the CAM 004 \[CSO sewer separation project from twenty years ago\]  was the construction of the Alewife Wetland. This wetland was constructed in the Alewife Reservation as part of sewer separation work. We need to demonstrate that we’re not increasing flooding… the Alewife Wetland serves two purposes. One is it provides what’s called stormwater detention, which is control of flows \[meaning reduction of flooding\]… It also provides treatment of stormwater through the plants and soils. This is a four acre installation,… a $12 million component of the CAM 004 \[Huron and Concord Ave area \] sewer separation project.”

**Emily Norton**, Executive Director of Charles River Watershed Association stated, “It is **not legal** to dump sewage in our rivers.”

https://preview.redd.it/2o3smaighzpf1.jpg?width=564&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e93f15036a7297916a1286977c8a82da3c05def9

**Patrick Herron**, Executive Director of the Mystic River Watershed Association said, “Imagine if you have just used the toilet and you live in a combined sewer area in Cambridge, you flush the toilet and whatever happened in that toilet arrives at Alewife Brook in the condition that it left. It’s not treated…. There are real consequences to this… **We would support one of two outcomes: complete sewer separation OR a 25-year level of control.**”

https://preview.redd.it/fu2fnn0ihzpf1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=620306d3dadd7f963128f29df4725fb039dc43b3

**Eppa Rixey**, Steering Committee Member from Save the Alewife Brook said, “We don’t see Cambridge committing to sewer separation in the Long Term Sewage Control Planning process.” Cambridge needs to include sewer separation in the Long Term Sewage Control Plan.

# The Roundtable Discussion

https://preview.redd.it/5o35ip9jhzpf1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99eb16c2cee8a9e73093c84719ee21f6c9fb7791

**Chair of Health & Environment Committee Councillor Patty Nolan** said,  
“**It’s a public health threat**, in addition to a calamity and an economic disaster when that flooding occurs… It’s an existential threat that affects our lives across so many different domains. We need to keep that in mind as we think about ways to do this… **How can we not address this when this is something critical to our future and livability as a city?** **We’re Cambridge. We can solve this.** And if we can’t, then who can? We look forward to hopefully having the Coalition work together with both the Council and the City Staff as we move forward, understanding this will supplement the work that’s being done.”

# Slowness of the Project Progress

With the Long Term Sewage Planning process now in its fourth year, Councillors at the meeting expressed concerns. They believe the City needs to move faster to end sewage pollution.

# Cost Concerns were raised

[Vice Mayor McGovern](https://preview.redd.it/id5ubpxmhzpf1.jpg?width=676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4589bd3f1697fcf1d84a1d7ab50e0e3582ce5284)

**Vice Mayor McGovern** said, “What are we doing at the State level to push our State Representatives and State Senators to figure out what they can do, to figure out how to get more money?”



[Councillor Cathie Zusy](https://preview.redd.it/791ym9aphzpf1.jpg?width=622&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d8edabd8713a244302bff0cb7fdcc32fcfc2c10)

**Councillor Cathie Zusy** asked, “Will we \[Cambridge\] be paying the $30 million \[for the CSO tank at Bellis Circle / Sherman Street\] or will MWRA be paying for it?”

Cambridge’s **City Engineer Jim Wilcox** replied, “that is part of the cost-sharing discussion with MWRA.”

**Charles River Watershed Association’s Executive Director Emily Norton said,** “I respect that MWRA tries to keep rates low. But how much do we value clean water? How much do we value not having toilet paper and tampon applicators going into our basements? How much do we value being able to swim in the Charles River? Our [**Cut the Crap**](https://www.crwa.org/cutthecrap) campaign is also directed at MWRA. People want to see this. Let’s have a conversation about how we pay for it. There are creative ways to raise funds.”

**Councillor Patty Nolan said,** “Cambridge has been spending $30 to $50 million ***each year*** on sewer infrastructure and stormwater control.”

# Neighborhood construction concerns came up.

https://preview.redd.it/ko5v5v9shzpf1.jpg?width=230&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a09c398907366ecb1faacaab020c20ab581c7184

**Councillor Azeem** said, “The neighbors feel that \[sewage pollution\] is a negative impact already. So maybe the neighborhood would be willing to put up with disruption in the short run, if it meant that \[sewage pollution\] would become less of a problem in the future.”

  
**Cambridge City Engineer Jim Wilcox said,** “When we do these sewer separation projects, it’s not just doing the sewer separation work. We also have to look at the condition of the other utilities that are in the street, particularly water utilities, gas utilities. So it’s not just sewer separation work, it’s also other work that needs to be done at the same time.”

https://preview.redd.it/2jmiettthzpf1.jpg?width=229&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ee21b5c220cece42bd0a228f2c44b3f5790267b

**Councillor Wilson said, “**That health conditions have developed from not handling this sooner is a concern to me… In terms of timeline, where is the level of urgency when working with our capital partners \[MWRA & Somerville\]?”

**Vice Mayor McGovern** said, “I know the concerns around doing too much construction and too much upheaval in neighborhoods. And I know construction is never a pleasant thing. But it’s necessary. And I’m glad that we’re a city that is continuing to invest in infrastructure improvements. I, too, want to be on record saying, how can we move more quickly?”

It seems to be affiliated with something called Mass Save, but I can't tell if Mass Save is a state program or a company. From the Neeeco FAQ: 

**What is a Designated Equity Community?** A designated equity community is a neighborhood identified by Mass Save® as having been historically underserved when it comes to energy efficiency programs. With their newest program updates, these communities have access to incredible home energy-saving upgrades for $0! Over 20 Massachusetts towns qualify – [contact our team](tel:7817765711) to check if your home is eligible.



**Are these upgrades really no cost or is there a catch?** While this may sound too good to be true, many upgrades are truly offered at no cost if your home qualifies. **There’s no catch or hidden fees.**

The program is designed to help more households—especially in Designated Equity Communities—access energy-saving improvements without the financial burden.

  
**How is the program funded?** Mass Save is funded by the energy efficiency charges on all customers’ gas and electric bills. You are already paying into the Mass Save program, so why not take advantage of a [no-cost home energy assessment](https://neeeco.com/mass-save-home-energy-assessment/) and Mass Save rebates?

* Burhan Azeem
* Dana Bullister
* Marc McGovern
* Ned Melanson
* Sumbul Siddiqui
* Denise Simmons
* Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler
* Ayesha Wilson



From their site:

**Burhan Azeem** is running for his third term on the Cambridge City Council. Councillor Azeem is an MIT graduate who grew up in an immigrant family fearing eviction. Before pursuing elected office, he was on the board of A Better Cambridge, and he founded statewide housing advocacy non-profit Abundant Housing Massachusetts. He also worked as an engineer and a volunteer EMT. In his first term, he co-sponsored the policy order that ended parking minimums and fought to expand the Affordable Housing Overlay. This past term, he played a key role alongside Councillor Siddiqui in ending exclusionary zoning, making Cambridge a nation-wide leader in tackling the housing crisis. Burhan understands the critical role building more housing plays in fighting climate change.

**Dana Bullister** is a Boston area native, Wellesley College graduate, and longtime Cambridge renter. Dana has worked as a data scientist and product manager, applying her skills to help both citizens and small businesses. She is currently pursuing doctoral studies at the intersection of design and policy at Northeastern University. Her campaign’s mission is to help all Cambridge residents have the opportunity to thrive. Not having a car, Dana relies on public transit, biking, and walking, informing her service on the commercial parking control committee. Dana understands how Cambridge’s housing shortage pushes neighbors out of town, breaking community ties forcing too many to drive long distances into work. An avid member of the local innovation ecosystem, Dana also serves as chair of the board of directors for the YWCA Cambridge, which provides safe and affordable housing to our most vulnerable.

**Marc McGovern** is a 5th-generation Cantabrigian, father, and social worker who has served as Mayor and Vice Mayor of Cambridge. Since joining the Council in 2013, he has led on housing issues, including increasing the linkage fee to fund affordable housing, providing municipal housing vouchers, and expanding the Affordable Housing Overlay. As a social worker of 30 years, he has worked with some of Massachusetts’ most vulnerable families and knows the difference stable housing can make in a person’s life. Marc understands that the “character” of Cambridge is not the look of its buildings, but the character of the people who live in those buildings. Marc is committed to building more housing as the key to making Cambridge a thriving, diverse, multi-cultural city.

**Ned Melanson** is a public defender at Cambridge District Court and disability advocate who was born in Holyoke, MA, went to college in Pittsburgh, and graduated from BC Law. As a renter living on Allston Street in Cambridgeport for the past 5 years, he has experienced Cambridge’s affordability challenges firsthand. Ned is a walker, cyclist, Red Line-rider, and all-around progressive urbanist. As a housing advocate who previously volunteered with A Better Cambridge, he supports more homes, more affordable homes, and more tenants' rights. Ned has also made standing up to federal overreach a key part of his campaign. As a lover of all things outdoors and protector of the environment, Ned understands how building more homes in Cambridge preserves New England’s incredible natural beauty.

**Sumbul Siddiqui** grew up in Cambridge public housing and worked in Legal Aid before serving as a Councillor and as Mayor. She has advocated on behalf of Cambridge’s most vulnerable and consistently led on displacement, tenant protection legislation, and the creation and preservation of affordable housing. During her terms as Mayor from 2020 to 2023, Sumbul guided the city through unprecedented challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, launching a Disaster Relief Fund, organizing testing and vaccine sites, and chairing the School Committee through multiple school reopenings. She is also a passionate advocate for Cambridge’s income assistance and universal preschool programs. Most recently, she played a key role alongside Councillor Azeem in ending exclusionary zoning and legalizing multifamily housing in all neighborhoods – keeping Cambridge a nation-wide leader in taking on the housing crisis.

**Denise Simmons** is a lifelong Cantabrigian who has served on City Council since 2002 and has served three terms as Mayor, including the current term. As a longtime chair of the Housing Committee, she played a key role in shepherding both the original 100% Affordable Housing Overlay and its 2023 expansion, and supported tripling the linkage fee that commercial developers pay into the Affordable Housing Trust. She has led on funding legal services for tenants facing eviction and pushed for the creation of the Housing Liaison to the City Manager position, a key role providing services to residents facing housing insecurity. Denise is a proud member of the LGBTQ community and a staunch advocate for Cambridge’s senior population and the housing challenges they face.

**Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler** is a renter, a tenant organizer, the son of an immigrant, and a democratic socialist, fighting for housing justice and tenants’ rights. In his 2020-2021 term as City Councillor, he helped pass the original Affordable Housing Overlay and increase the City’s affordable housing linkage fee. He has worked as a governance director for the Working Families Party to craft legislation on affordable housing, childcare, and more. Jivan supported expanding the AHO, ending exclusionary zoning, and utilizing Cambridge’s Prop 2.5 levy capacity to put millions more towards affordable housing each year. Jivan is a statewide leader for strengthening tenant rights, including passage of a state law that ends forced renter-paid broker's fees.

**Ayesha M. Wilson** is a social worker and lifelong Cambridge resident. She worked as a teacher-counselor with the Cambridge Housing Authority’s workforce program. Prior to joining the Council, she served two terms on the school committee, where she worked on the City’s universal pre-K program, advocated for the Office of Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging, and secured funding for new school social workers. She grew up in public housing at Jefferson Park and held a Section 8 voucher. She supported ending exclusionary zoning and increasing affordable housing in her first term. Through her work and lived housing experience, Ayesha understands the challenges faced by those who cannot afford childcare and housing in Cambridge and will center the voices of those who face being forced to leave Cambridge because they can no longer afford to live here.

I live in Cambridgeport and have recently noticed a gentleman who seems to be living out of his vehicle with Old Morse Park as a sort of home base. I've seen his truck parked there regularly, with a bunch of personal/living supplies inside (not that I've peeked in, it's just kind of overflowing and on the sidewalks sometimes). He seems to be using the outlets at the park for his appliances, the water fountain to clean dishes, and has a grill secured to the bike rack. Sometimes I notice he has some visitors.

He doesn't seem to be bothering anyone, and I’m not looking to report anything — just genuinely curious if anyone else has noticed this or knows more about the situation. I'm mainly wondering if this is a long-standing thing I just hadn’t noticed before, or if it’s something newer in the area.

I went to this so you didn't have to! Actually I went to do some research for my show and it was steps from my apartment. Speaking of my show, did I mention we've interviewed all of the challengers (except for Robert Winters (LibsofTikTok fan) and Tim Flaherty (he had to cancel interview due to court obligation and wasn't interested in rescheduling) here?: [What's That About? Special 2025 Challenger Candidate for City Council Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL395FYpKfPtnFQU19IENUFnKuO4VWDRG8)

Here are my notes:

**Most Importantly** Mayor Denise Simmons couldn't attend because ICE kidnapped some poor Cambridge soul off the street. She stopped in to announce this had happened and that they were working to help the family involved, but wouldn't have any more details till later. 

On to the non-fascist stuff:

There were two separate forums, adding up to 14 candidates. Each candidate was given 90 seconds to introduce themselves. After the intros, each candidate was asked questions for 4 minutes in turn by Jesse Kanson-Benanav, Executive Director of Abundant Housing MA (CORRECTED), based on the candidate's answers to the ABC [questionnaire](https://www.abettercambridge.org/25quest). The candidates did not interact much with each other's answers. Below are my brief impressions of what they said based on my notes. I'm trying to stay as accurate to the meat of what they actually said, minimizing editorializing.

Group one: Patty Nolan, Ned Melanson, Ayah Al-Zubi, Zion Sherin, Peter Hsu, Ayesha Wilson, Marc McGovern

**Patty N**: Says: she is data-driven ""for better or worse"". Not afraid to take unpopular positions if the data tells her to. She says  she wants 5 foot ""step-backs"" for higher stories of tall buildings along Mass Ave corridor, not ""set-backs"" which was what she wrote? Seems to be for rent stabilization. Says she wants to streamline ""onerous"" regulations. 

**Ned M**: Says: Housing is the most pressing issue of our time. It is morally important to build more density in transit oriented Cambridge. ""Suburban experiment has failed"" Environmentally the right thing to do. Blue states need more housing. Says he supports Social Housing.

**Ayah A-Z**: Says she is a renter who has been forced to move 5x in 7 years, forced her to organize her fellow renters for tenant protections, if elected vows to push city for much stronger tenant protections. Strong advocate for ""deeply affordable housing"" and social housing. Wants to center communities of color. Took city to task for shutting down transitional wellness center shelter. Aims to re-open a non-congregate shelter if elected.

**Zion S**: Spoke for co-ops and more dorm-like housing for young people. Wants to leverage bond rating to build affordable housing. Wants to go back to previous setbacks in neighborhood and spoke a lot about not changing neighborhoods in push to build more housing. Wants to keep yards, says ""green roofs can't support bunnies"".  Doesn't seem to want to knock down any building more than 50 years old. Says knocking down buildings is very disruptive and ruins neighborhoods, he knows because he's been on construction work sites, unlike his co-candidates(he implied) 

**Peter H**. Says he's the only one running on a public health platform. Says housing is a public health issue. Wants to prioritize housing for certain occupations. When asked, he said exact occupations would be picked by ""community discussion"". Wants to build tall on corridors and squares. 

**Ayesha W**: Wants to protect rights of people already here. Not ready to commit on CSQ rezoning, thinks we need more community input. Says because the community is not sure, she is not sure. Will only be ready when community is ready. Also backs social housing.

**Marc M**: Says ""I'm lucky, I've always had a place to live."" Even when his family struggled growing up. His great-grand parents bought their place in the 1920's. If not for them he  wouldn't be able to live here. ""Being housed shouldn't rely on luck"" Wants to build more affordable housing on public lands. Made the point that density not only good for the environment, but for the culture and small business. Also (my impression) subtly referenced Ayesha Wilson's comment by saying sometimes you need to make a controversial decision, it's the job.

\------

Group Two: Stan Rivkin, Burhan Azeem, Sumbul Siddiqui, Dana Bullister, Louise Venden, Jivan Sobrinho Wheeler, Catherine Zusy (arrived later)

**Stan R**: Says: Cambridge is one of the most unequal cities in the country by income. We've relied too much on private developments. Strongly against decreasing 20% affordable housing requirement. Speaks strongly for ""deeply affordable housing"" and social housing. Points out most current affordable housing requirements completely leave out anyone making below 56k per year. Speaks for the need to raise taxes if necessary to achieve social housing goals, points out Cambridge has the lowest residential tax rates in the state.

**Burhan A**: When questioned on why he thought the proposed 8 stories on Cambridge St. corridor is too high, he mentions that those sizes don't pencil out and will falsely raise expectations. Thinks 6 stories is better. Points out the ""missing-middle"" that he tried to push through city-wide was partially criticized because it wouldn't produce enough housing. Wants to implement tax abatements to encourage more affordable housing construction. Thinks historical commissions influence should be reduced, currently they're being used as a NIMBY veto (my words) for good projects.

**Sumbul S**: Grew up in Cambridge Affordable housing. Wants to increase heights especially in squares and corridors. Wants to push infill housing, good for community and the environment.

**Dana B**: Says she loves Cambridge a lot. Wants more housing choices for people including smaller units and SROs if there's demand. Thinks its important to build more housing in Cambridge because it gives people option of being car-less. Status quo forces people to be drivers who don't want to be. Wants tenants to have more power to negotiate, and thinks best way to do that is to add more units. Wants to legalize mid-rise single stair housing, remove other unnecessary regs.

**Louise V**: Says Government needs to be accountable and city hasn't done enough research before implementing new housing regs. Wants to do more studies to figure out where to build housing. Says last study in 2019 (Envision Cambridge) is too long ago. Apparently doesn't think CSQ needs 18 stories, public doesn't want it. She used to be elected official in Provincetown, they had a housing trust and public-private housing partnerships. Wants to do more of those in Cambridge. Doesn't want to disrupt historic neighborhoods.

**Jivan S-W**: Backed new multi-family zoning, says less stringent setback requirements were necessary to change incentives. Status quo had meant triple deckers were vulnerable to being tore down and replaced with millionaire single family homes because setbacks were required (almost all existing triple-deckers would not be legal under old exclusionary zoning). Wants to increase linkage fees to fund more social housing.

**Catherine Z**: Voted against multi-family zoning because she says it will hurt neighborhoods. Won't support 2030 goal of 12,500 more housing units in Envision study. Walks back criticism of ABC as ""paid special interest group"".

I’m curious about the structure, direction and priority setting,  and oversight of Cambridge Police. 

There has been plenty of criticism about the lack of enforcement of traffic laws, and lots of other complaints about police blowing off citizens concerns. These all seem like legitimate concerns. There also seem to be some interesting community engagement initiatives and goals about lowering. But beyond the five year strategic plan for 2016-2020, I see nothing about there actual strategies and priorities online. 

Also, who is responsible for police oversight? I mean both for the small things like cops parking personal cars anywhere, with their ticket pads used as defacto permits (this is what motivated this post…), to the big issues like potential corruption or excessive use of force. I’m not saying this is happening (except the parking thing of course) but curious what the process is.

The stretch I ran spans from around the intersection of Putnam Ave and Flagg St to Mt. Auburn / the 1 Bus stop.
The pens have a large sentimental significance to me. I have a tile tracker in the case and over the course of the past day the tracker has been pinged by folks in the tile community at the locations in the attached pictures.

I would be beyond grateful if anyone has stumbled across it and might be able to return it. I feel like an idiot for not at least writing my phone number somewhere to help it find its way back to me in the case the tracker was insufficient.

(I think the motorcycle had the right of way, but came in really fast and blind to the pedestrian in the crosswalk.)

I ditched my bike and grabbed my phone to call 911 and ran into the center of the intersection. So did a couple other people who saw. The pedestrian was knocked out cold and bloody, but he regained a little consciousness while I was on the phone. I was one of the people kneeling on the asphalt trying to talk to him and hold him still, because his left leg was shattered and he was extremely confused and trying to move around which was bending his leg. I was basically holding his shoulders/arms and he was holding me back a little bit. Got kind of a lot of blood on my forearms. And I figured as a crowd of people in the intersection, we were doing the job of being visible to the cars coming from the 3 incoming traffic directions.

Ambulance response was really fast. It was probably like 5 minutes tops between call and arrival. So I of course got out of the way when they showed up. I picked up the shattered pieces of the guy's headphones but he's probably not getting those back ha... I gave the police my statement and one of the officers went and got a wet wipe for my arms. I then went to work.

Anyway I know there's no way the police will call me with any updates... But I'd like to know if the guy is okay, beyond the shattered leg. I think I heard him tell the EMT that his name was John.

Background: In response to a lawsuit filed 8/6/2025, Judge Ellis issued a Temporary Restraining Order to halt construction of the Linear Park Redesign on 8/13/2025, until arguments could be heard on Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction to halt construction, while the case proceeds. The following is the latest status from Cambridge on what the consequences of a Preliminary Injunction would be:

>*III. Upcoming Project Deadlines/Scheduling and Project Impacts*

>*At present, all preparation work for the Project has been placed on hold, pending the Court's decision regarding Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. Prior to the ordered halt in construction, the City's contractor had plans to immediately start work on the Park's multi-use path, including but not limited to demolition, utility improvements and repaving of the multi-use path. Watkins Aff.,* ***¶*** *21. This work was scheduled to be performed this fall. Id. The City's contractor has informed the City that, due to the currently ordered hold, the contractors must delay the proposed fall repaving work. Watkins Aff.,* ***¶*** *22. If the Plaintiffs preliminary injunction is granted and the ordered hold extends beyond September 12, the City's contractors may be unable to perform the scheduled paving of the path within the fall construction season. The City cannot perform construction past November, due to cold weather conditions. Watkins Aff.,* ***¶*** *23. Likewise, the City will likely be unable to address the Park's drainage and accessibility deficiencies on the multi-use path before the winter. Watkins Aff.,* ***¶*** *24.*

>*Delays in these portions of the Project will also make it unlikely that the City will complete the project by 2026 as planned, effectively pushing the work out by another construction season. Watkins Aff.,* ***¶*** *26. Due to the lack of a working irrigation system and the Park's current drainage issues, and continued soil impaction due to travel off the multi-use path by pedestrians and bicyclists, the existing mature trees will continue to be stressed. Watkins Aff.,* ***¶*** *26.*

>*Finally, the city is likely to incur additional costs in the event of an extended construction period due to holds. Delays in the Project will likely force the City to expend additional funds for the Project that it would not ordinarily have to pay. For example, if construction is further delayed for this year's fall, the City's contractors may have to submit change orders to address any costs incurred due to the delays. Watkins Aff.,* ***¶*** *28.*

>*These harms due to the inability to meet Project deadlines, in addition to the harms outlined in the City's Opposition, further demonstrates that the granting of the Plaintiffs' Injunctive Relief adversely harms the public's interest.*

>*CITY OF CAMBRIDGE*

Source: [https://www.masscourts.org/eservices/home.page](https://www.masscourts.org/eservices/home.page) , Superior Court, Middlesex County, Case Number 2581CV01914, *Defendant City of Cambridge's Supplement in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction*, dated 8/27/2025.

Judge Ellis will consider if the Preliminary Injunction should be granted or denied soon (this will not end the case, but will determine if construction can resume while the case proceeds).

Now I will editorialize a bit after reading the \~9 documents submitted so far to the Court by Cambridge: The Linear Park improvement project plants over 150 trees, fixes the (10+ year broken) irrigation system to protect the existing and new trees, greatly improves the soils (loosing compacted soil, replacing poor quality soil with high quality horticultural soil) to protect the existing and new trees, creates permeable side paths to reduce pedestrians and bicyclists from going off-path which compacts soils and damages the existing and new trees, and the 8/22/2025 sworn statement from the City's Tree Warden David Lefcourt is **0 mature trees will be cut**. (P.S. There is a great, expansive defense of the Linear Park Redesign here https://plaffd.github.io/net/linearpark. It was written in 2023 so if anything, it *understates* the benefits on sworn record to the Court submitted in August 2025).

Plaintiff's main legal problem: In plain language, the 1984 MBTA lease to Cambridge **mandates** the property **shall** be used for (the explicit word the MBTA used is!) **bicyclists**; the entire park lease could be **revoked** if Cambridge acted otherwise, which is why the park has been continuously used by... bicyclists! since it opened in 1985. So, the park has always included a shared use path (SUP), which has always been paved, which has always been allowed. The MBTA lease entirely lacks **any** restrictions on path material, width, or length. Bringing a 1985 SUP into compliance with modern Federal and State standards for SUPs (which is what this project does, along with the many aforementioned tree **improvements** and a wide variety of additional public amenities like eliminating the flooding with proper drainage, lighting, emergency call boxes, resting benches, signage, trash/recycling, water stations) seems (to me) *obviously* not a change of use, which is Plaintiff's fundamental argument as to why the project should be cancelled by the Court.

Going out on a ""limb"", if you will pardon the expression: I'm guessing Plaintiffs are going to lose their case, in the end. I *hope* the Preliminary Injection is Denied soon for the above reasons, but I suppose we will have to wait and see...",https://www.reddit.com/r/CambridgeMA/comments/1n2fklf/latest_linear_park_status_potential_costs_and/,rocketwidget,1756395333.0,2025-08-28T11:35:33,41,60

Also true: I lost a friend who was hit by a car while crossing the street. My brother was hit and injured in a crosswalk withe the Walk sign.

I had a similar experience on Beacon St.  And nearly every week I read about pedestrians being killed or injured by cars. 

Drivers don’t take pedestrians seriously because they don’t have to. Drivers don’t get hurt, and even when they hit someone, it’s usually dismissed as an “accident.”  The numbers bear me out.  7000+ pedestrians are killed by drivers every year in the US, 68,000 are seriously injured.

How do you handle the  city of Cambridge water bills?
As a condo owner, wondering if it makes sense to charge per unit or just according to condo percentages. Prices have been increasing over the past few years and it feels like I am subsidizing my neighbors water use. I want it to be fair, for example in a 3 unit building we each pay 33.3 percent. But these unit percentages were determined in the 1980s and do not reflect current usage.

I didn’t use Uber for a couple of years because it was so obvious that their biz model included money maximizing algorithms - rather than route efficiency ones. 
I.e. routing your trip to make the most money possible without being too obvious about the inefficient routes. Corroborated by obfuscated charging models (distance, traffic, … ). 

I missed my bus tonight and took an uber. Their route was from Kendall Square to East Cambridge via Boston.  Hahaha 

When I pointed it out, the driver said it was because it was due to being picked up on a  street where he can’t turn at the end.  That only was the case because he picked me up on the other (wrong) side of the street. 
The driver was great - not his fault. I told him where to go instead. 
But basically for the 1 mile that it was, I was charged $14. The charge was calculated based on the suggested Boston route. When I tried to report it in the app as a routing issue, there was no option for any refund despite the driver going the shorter / quicker route. Instead it thanked me for reporting routing issues. I can only laugh at this point. 

TLDR: Uber has solidified its position as an obvious scammer taking advantage of ppl by using obfuscated charging models and inefficient routing algorithms.  I will go back to avoiding them whenever possible. We need an alternative.

We were all given official warnings. I understand we all broke the law and rightfully should not have; I'm grateful I didn't get the frankly deserved ticket and I am not going to break that law again.

While standing on the sidewalk being written a ticket I looked 100 yards up Mass ave and see a large box truck with its hazards on parked in the bike lane and park of traffic lane, then look down the other end 50 yards and see another box truck with it's hazards on parked at the bus stop right next to a visible sign that read 'No Parking Anytime.'

I pointed out one of the illegally parked trucks to an officer when he was handing me back my license and he told me ""it doesn't look like it's blocking anything"" then walked away.

Good for stopping cyclists to make Mass Ave safer for pedestrians/cars too, but why don't they also target the trucks/food delivery drivers constantly parked in the bike lanes, or the cars blantantly running red lights too?

Somerville Public Schools and Cambridge Public Schools both want an exorbitant amount of money. I've reached out to every preschool in that area, as well as Saint James, all of the banks, and Star Market. I've also attempted to contact Porter Square Shopping Center and Porter Square Galleria. And probably some other places that I didn't write down. The only lead I have right now is Lesley University, but only if they're able to work something out with us about their pricing (the last I heard, they were interested in seeing what they could do, so fingers crossed.)

=============

Hi! Our Daisy Girl Scout troop (Kindergarteners, so in the 5-6 age range) is looking for a space to host twice-monthly meetings, ideally on Wednesday evenings.

I'll list below the places I've already reached out to or otherwise considered, but I was hoping to get some outside-the-box suggestions.

In particular, it should be a location that doesn't require a car to get to, but which does have nearby parking options. We also won't have much in the way of funds, and I'd rather use what we will have directly on the scouts, rather than reservation fees.

The troop is technically based in Somerville, because that's where I am, but my assistant leader lives in Cambridge, and we have scouts from both cities. So we're open to either, and I'm cross-posting this to reach a wider audience.

Cambridge Masonic Temple - other troops hold their meetings here, and I need to call the building manager because he won't discuss it via email (this has actually been a major stumbling block for me), but the options (depending on availability with their own events) are either the gymnasium--which would be good--or the conference room--which I was warned would be less ideal for our age group.

Somerville Community Growing Center - they don't really have indoor space (a commenter in another sub warned me that it's basically just a small shed full of gardening equipment), plus when they finally responded, they sounded dubious about it being a good option for a bunch of little kids. They request a flat $200 per year donation for using the space, which would be fine if we were able to use it year around, but not if it's going to be seasonal.

Arts at the Armory - even their classroom space is way too expensive ($20/hour, and they sound super strict about scheduling, like charging extra if you go over by a couple minutes)

Council on Aging locations - they don't have the availability

Mystic Activity Center - not available after 5pm

Somerville Public Library - they require that all events be free and open to the public and listed on their calendar

Cambridge Public Library - ditto *and* they only let you book once per quarter per group

Somerville Public Schools - I hear they're difficult to get permission for, and their website makes it sound super expensive, but I did email our principal and vice principal about it directly (and have not heard back, despite sending a follow-up).

Cambridge Public Schools - I really just don't know anything about this possibility, as I don't have a child in CPS.

Connexion - I *really* don't want to hold the meetings in a religious space, and I don't know how other families would feel about it, either, plus their location seems really not ideal in terms of people being able to get there without driving. But I can reach out if that is what we want to do (they sound really chill and progressive, as far as religious organizations go, and host a lot of community events).

George Dilboy VFW Post 529 - sounds like they're great for one-off events, but not regularly-scheduled meetings

Playgrounds - weather-dependent

Another local troop leader said they used to host meetings at a private preschool, but I wouldn't even know where to start with that

There are some spaces around Assembly Square. It feels less accessible to me, location-wise, but we can definitely pursue that.

Cambridge Foundry - This would be *amazing*. It would cost $8/meeting, I think, due to our ""weekly"" schedule, and our non-profit status and expected revenue. That is definitely doable for such a fantastic space. We are on their list for the Fall, but at the very bottom, but maybe we can get in for Winter and in the future.

Cambridge Women's Center - I emailed them, and have recently sent a follow-up, but have not received a response.

Danger Wizard - They did say they're considering renting out their space outside of business hours, but quoted $15 per hour for just a *table* (sharing the space with random strangers really doesn't work for us, even if the fee were lower).

One of our parents has reached out to the building they live in about using the common meeting space, but hasn't heard back.

So, what am I missing? 

(Sorry for any weird typos. I'm posting this from my phone on an airplane. And it ate my bullet points when I pasted from Google Docs, ugh.)

Or at least some inspiration.,"Not Just Bikes is probably one of my favorite channels to share with bike infrastructure skeptics so I thought I’d share the latest video I watched. He’s great because a) I spent three years in the Netherlands before moving here a year ago so it’s sentimental for me, and more importantly, b) his take on non-car infrastructure is experience and fact based, not emotional. He acknowledges some of the downfalls and limitations. 

I really liked this video because it really highlights that cars and bikes can coexist, but also that deprioritizing cars doesn’t mean deprioritizing a specific group of residents like kids or mobility limited groups. It also emphasizes the positive impact reducing cars has on the feel and perceived liveliness of even a small sleepy town. I recognize that the Netherlands has a far more robust train system connecting neighboring towns, but Boston and surrounding towns have such potential despite this. 

All to say, next time you are chatting with your bike skeptic neighbor or uncle or (as in my case) uncomfortably politically involved landlord, I highly encourage you to share a video or two from this channel, even if just to get them thinking a tiny bit more openly and critically about non-car infrastructure.

The 18 best sandwich shops in Greater Boston

The Boston area is known for innovation — and this includes the hard-working sandwich artists improving on what’s already the perfect food. There’s a masterpiece around every corner — classic Italian subs stacked with imported meat and cheese, exquisitely crunchy bánh mì, meatloaf slathered in cheese and slapped between bread for healing after a night on the town. The sandos on The Boston Globe’s Best of the Best list are made with such care that they must be savored, but so good you’ll probably end up scarfing them down. (If you’re craving something a little different, check out The Boston Globe‘s Best of the Best picks for cheap eats.)

**Ali’s Roti**
Ali’s Roti Mona Miri for The Boston Globe
This Trinidadian spot, open for more than three decades, is beloved for its huge roti sandwiches — curried meat and vegetables held together by Indian-Caribbean-style flatbread. In addition to proteins such as chicken and bone-in goat, you get a choice of fillings such as potato, steamed cabbage, and chickpeas (vegetarian options are available). The result is comforting and flavorful, with just a touch of heat. Bring your appetite: The rotis are easily enough for two.

After a night out, recover the next day with a grilled meatloaf sandwich blanketed in melted Jack cheese on sourdough, or a sinfully thick grilled cheese on white, further corrupted by béchamel sauce. From fries drenched in All Star’s “Inner Beauty” hot sauce to gravy-smothered poutine — there are no rules here.

**Al’s Cafe**
Al’s is where long lines go to die: Even during the peak of lunch rush, it’s possible to be in and out in five minutes thanks to the efficient sandwich-assembly process. Al’s is also one of the last places in Boston where you can get a hearty, quality sandwich (the chicken salad is can’t-miss) at a reasonable price. The subs are so big you might have leftovers for dinner, but so tasty that you shouldn’t count on it. There are multiple locations in the Boston area.

**Ba Lẹ**
Ask any bánh mì aficionado which place makes their favorite sandwich and you are likely to hear about this shop, which also sells Vietnamese prepared foods and smoothies. Ba Lẹ has been making stellar bánh mì in Dorchester for decades. The key is the bread: crusty, baguette-like rolls baked daily. The team behind the counter slathers them with house-made mayo and layers on grilled meats, pâté, and pickled vegetables at warp speed; the inevitable lunch line moves swiftly. Other locations in Malden and Quincy.

**Chacarero**
Chacarero Adam DeTour for The Boston Globe; Food styling by Shiela Jarnes
This tiny Chilean counter-service place is legendary among sandwich lovers, especially among the Financial District’s office workers who frequent it. After starting out as a downtown pushcart, Chacarero is known today in part for what put it on the map — the BBQ beef sandwich made with house-made round bread and also stuffed with cheese, tomatoes, green beans, avocado, and a tangy hot sauce. It’s a taste of Chile in downtown Boston.

**Cutty’s**
Husband-wife chefs Charles and Rachel Kelsey met while working at America’s Test Kitchen. When they opened Cutty’s in 2010, it was one of the first shops in the area to elevate sandwiches with top quality ingredients, house-roasted meats, and locally grown vegetables. Since then, they’ve racked up the accolades, including being named to The New York Times’s list of the 25 best restaurants in Boston. The broccoli rabe, tomato jam, mozzarella, and provolone on a seeded roll is a testament to their skill and imagination.

There’s no stress about what to order at this friendly Nubian Square staple. The only question: Steak and cheese with what? Peppers and onions are a good starting point, but mushrooms and eggs are options as well — and you can’t go wrong. Even a “small” sub spills over with shaved meat and mild melted cheese, piping hot off the grill. Other sandwiches and pizza are on the menu, as well.

It’s hard to look past this standout, but the roast chicken, lamb, and grilled mushroom-brie sandwiches would like a word.

The empanadas come with a host of savory filling choices, from the traditional beef and chicken to the less common eggplant and conch, all housed in a flaky dough. Or try a Caribbean-style sandwich, such as the patacón, which substitutes fried green plantains for bread. To wash it down, there’s a selection of refreshing juices and smoothies.

Now a home-grown mini-chain, Tenóch first earned a following in Medford with its husky tortas: a pressed stack of marinated meat, vegetables, mild Oaxacan cheese, and a zippy slather of chipotle mayo on spongy telera bread. Those are a filling meal (and, at about $11, an affordable one).

If you believe (rightly) that bread is the foundation upon which sandwich excellence rests, make this family-owned Italian shop your next stop. Choose from a cornucopia — ciabatta, bastone, and, especially, braided treccia — baked in house daily. Fillings are equally worthy, from prosciutto with fresh mozzarella to chicken parm to the indecisive person’s holy grail: the Italian, containing all the salumi at once. There is always a line, and it’s always worth it.

For our upcoming meeting, we're diving into ***Antifragile*** **by Nassim Nicholas Taleb**. ***Antifragile*** is a bold, brainy blueprint for not just surviving chaos—but thriving because of it. Nassim Taleb flips conventional thinking on its head, arguing that the most resilient systems—whether bodies, markets, or careers—actually gain strength from volatility, stress, and disorder. Mixing ancient wisdom, modern skepticism, and a sharp dose of ego, Taleb challenges readers to rethink risk, embrace randomness, and stop chasing fragile stability. It’s part philosophy, part economics, and all about building a life (and mindset) that grows stronger when the world doesn’t go according to plan.

* When: Saturday, August 23rd @ 10:00 AM
* Where: Somerville Public Library - Central Library, 79 Highland Ave, Somerville, MA, 02143, Auditorium (The venue does not sponsor or endorse this event)
* Format: Monthly meetings. Low-pressure, welcoming environment. We’ll discuss the book, share insights, and connect over forward-thinking ideas.

If you're curious about how to thrive in chaos—not just survive it—we’d love to have you join the conversation.

The rent in the area (North Cambridge) is average around $4,300. The units here will start at around $700. Sounds great, but not if you are a working-class American. The only people who will be living here are ones who are near the federal-poverty line. 

This includes, disabled people, who I am not against living here. We have to take care of our disabled/elderly.

But each unit here will cost about ($700k!!!). That’s unacceptable. We’ll never tackle housing if that’s the price we are paying to build 300 units. 

The term “affordable housing” is a slap in the face to working-class Americans. They aren’t building these units for us. They’re building them for people who work very little or not at all (some not by choice!, they needs homes to) whose rent is subsidized by… the middle class. 

I’m all for building ANY type of housing as it helps with demand, but this just seems like a huge slap in the face when you’re neighbor is paying 1/6 of the rent you pay, while you work 40+ hours a week.

I'm Dana Ray Bullister and I'm running for Cambridge City Council.

I am a data scientist trained in economics and policy. I am also a longtime Cambridge renter reliant on transit and biking (I do not own a car). I serve as Board Chair of the YWCA Cambridge, an incredible local organization providing safe and affordable housing to our city's most vulnerable. I am currently pursuing a PhD at Northeastern University at the intersection of design and policy.

My priorities include

* Enabling a more inclusive, affordable, and vibrant city through abundant, transit-oriented housing (more details [here](https://danaforcambridge.com/#housing))
* Supporting a network of protected bike lanes
* Reducing vacant storefronts
* Better regulating parking (see [here](https://danaforcambridge.com/#fix-parking))
* Decreasing the influence of money in elections
* Enabling more accountable, responsive government

You can learn more about my full platform at [danaforcambridge.com](https://danaforcambridge.com/).

I'm running because I have a deep connection to this city and I hope to make it better. I also believe that, in this chaotic time, our city has a responsibility to model what it means to capably invest in our community and in the fundamental processes and services that matter. As a creative and knowledge hub, our community is uniquely positioned to lead in the vital task of envisioning and building better government.

My hope is to offer my background in communicating nuanced data topics in accessible ways to help our city make smart, caring, and effectual decisions in line with its values. I am committed to an open mind, thoughtful dialogue, and willingness to evolve perspectives given new insights.

It was a little over 10.2 cents/kWh. The rate went up to 14.81 cents/kWh. That's an over 40% increase. For context, even the default Eversource rate is cheaper than what we're being automatically enrolled into (it averages out to 14.0625 cents / kWh, but is actually dual rate depending on time of year [source](https://www.eversource.com/content/residential/account-billing/manage-bill/about-your-bill/rates-tariffs/electric-supply-rates)).

I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CambridgeMA/comments/16nb4tk/any_updates_on_2024_cambridge_community/) from a couple of years ago saying Cambridge was in the process of renegotiating electricity rates, but it doesn't seem like a new rate ever took effect.

My first/naive take is that it looks like the original rate (which was actually very good compared to the rest of the market) was never renegotiated and the residents of Cambridge are now being automatically enrolled into a slightly more expensive electricity rate compared to what's offered by default by Eversource. If you shop around, you can get an even better rate than what Eversource offers and that's without community bargaining... so what happened? Did Cambridge not renegotiate the rate or were rates significantly higher when the renegotiation happened? I'm a little bummed that the city is automatically enrolling people in a more expensive option than the default.

EDIT: Through reading some of the comments it seems like I had the wrong impression of the program. I originally joined at a time when the two year negotiated fixed rate reflected a good deal because energy costs spiked after the rate became fixed. The program is sometimes more expensive than the default rate. The program also includes as part of the default negotiated rate money for building local renewable energy projects which results in losing some of the savings versus Eversource rates. The green economy rate is a good deal given how flexible it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CambridgeMA/comments/1lu1k71/cambridge_community_electricity_program_more/,cowzombi,1751912046.0,2025-07-07T14:14:06,18,12

Anyone know what’s going on?",https://i.redd.it/cxmigiyo0yaf1.jpeg,quaransthetics,1751672173.0,2025-07-04T19:36:13,133,397

Company will be based in Kendall Square. Will be taking my soon to be HS junior with me. SHe is a straight A student, and active in chess, badminton and few leadership positions in clubs in current high school in San Diego. Is it wise to move now, esp considering potential impacts on grades, making friends and college admissions? He is outgoing and usually easily makes friends, but the move and adjustments will be stressful anyways. What area would you recommend to live- for easy commute and good school? Not super interested in a cut throat school environment, but looking for good schools with potential to take some classes at community college etc. Thanks !

Editing to add-

Thank you all for your kind responses!! Much appreciated! While we have been focusing on schools, would also like to get your opinions on what community/area to live in Cambridge- to be able to attend CRLS as well as be in a safe area near to commuter rail/bus or walking distance to Kendall square. Any apartment complexes to consider or avoid? Buying a 2bed/bath is in the considerations.
